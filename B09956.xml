            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HAd I been affected with that Itching Humour of Ambition to raiſe an Obelisk to my Memory, and leave behind me ſome Tokens, that I once Liv'd, and had a Being and Exiſtence upon Earth: How could I have contrived a more Glorious method for the Erecting this Eternal Monument, than by fixing Your Graces Name to theſe my poor weak Endeavours? For, who (ſeeing Your Honoured Name ſet before the Book,) will not be invited (by the Fairneſs of ſuch a Frontispiece) to look into the Sermons, and even practice the Duties intimated therein?</p>
            <p>Madam, I confeſs it high Preſumption, and I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg your Graces Pardon for borrowing your Name and Patronage, becauſe it looks like a deſign in me, that if there be no other worth in the Diſcourſes, yet at leaſt they may have the Virtues and Advantages of a Burning-Glaſs,
<pb facs="tcp:191991:5"/>which borrowing a Flame from the Great Eye of Heaven, Shines and Burns, not of it ſelf, but by the Rays and Emanations of its Bright Patron and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor: I will not pretend to vindicate my ſelf from ſo Holy a Suſpition, though ſomething more Enobled my Deſires to preſent Your Grace with this humble Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For I do confidently avow (not to Affront the Modeſty ſo Innate to Your Temper, or come within the Sphere of Flattery, ſo repugnant to my Genius,) that the Noble Perfections wherewith Heaven hath Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed You, have render'd You ſo Publickly Acquainted to the World, that he muſt not only be a Stranger to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but even to all Humane Society and Converſe, who converſe, who have not been ſenſibly ſurpriz'd in the Admiration of Your Virtues: Virtues which you Suckled in even with Your Milk, and have Thrived with ſo day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Encreaſe in the Sequel of Your Life, that they might Juſtly Challenge Shrines and Altars from us, if Your Humility did not ſignifie unto us a Reprimand. Theſe are ſuch Truths, that I dare not proceed to ſay any thing further concerning your Graces Perfections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible for me (had I the Tongue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) to expreſs my ſelf in a method proportionable to my Theam. I might, it is poſſible, ſuggeſt and hint to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future Ages, that Your Natural and Particular Inclinations are thoſe Virtues; yes, and in a much more Eminent Degree, which Deified far leſs Deſerving Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:

            <p>What need I to repeat the Immortality of Your Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Family, the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhall ſooner be diſplaced from its Orbe, the <hi>Stars</hi> forget their Motions, than Mankind forget to Celebrate the moſt Heroick, Loyal and Glorious Atchievments of the moſt Generous and Honourable <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?</hi> And Madam, You being one of the Noble Branches proceeding from that Loyal Stem, to whom can I Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf more properly in a Sermon on the Thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> then unto Your Grace? For not only <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, but likewiſe the Honourable <hi>Capel</hi> fell Sacrifices to a Uſurping Power, and both died Glorious Martyrs in Defence of Church and State.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe Your Grace then to accept theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, though preſented by a mean Hand, for they are intended for no other purpoſe; then to convince unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Wicked men of their Damnable and Helliſh Practices againſt the Church and State, and what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Labours they Groan under to effect their

               <hi>THey Mourned</hi>—And where is that ſullen Stoick? Shew me the Man that can condemn this their Pious Mourning? Who can deny a Tear at ſuch a ſad Solemnity? Where is that flinty breaſt that can forbear to Sorrow in ſuch a caſe? No Loyal Subject to the Thron of <hi>Saul</hi> can be ſo baſe, as to deny a yearly Subſidy, when Princes Hearſes claim it as its due? Natural Affection will break forth into Sighs and Tears at the Corruption of what we Love; when that grim Serjeant of Nature, Death,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:191991:7"/>hath ſnatcht from us any, link'd unto us by the tyes of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; How do we diſſolve into Tears! How great are our Griefs and Sorrows!</p>
            <p>Now if we be judg'd inſenſible, for our not relenting the loſs of Friends? What brand of ſhame and Infamy do they deſerve, who neither Mourn, Weep, or Faſt when a <hi>Cypreſs Vail</hi> hath over-ſpread the <hi>Royal Diadem?</hi> Shall we not be Dejected and Sorrowful, when the Sword of Death hath cut off Him in whoſe Hand alone reſted the Sword of Juſtice? Shall not We Faſt and Weep at the Fatal Cataſtrophe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan?</hi> Are not our Souls Elemented, as it were, of nothing but Sadneſs, when our Ears are pierced with the lamentable news of the fall of the People of the Lord, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the ſad misfortune of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael. Moſes</hi>'s Death may juſtly command a Briniſh ſhower, but much more if accompanied with that of <hi>Aaron;</hi> if <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt, Nobles</hi> and <hi>Subjects, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the ſame misfortune, then certainly we muſt want words, to expreſs the bitterneſs of our Griefs. <hi>Niobe</hi> found a vent for her Paſſion, when made unhappy by the loſs of one, or two, of her little Babes; but when rob'd of all, ſhe became Inſenſible. <hi>Curae leves loquuntur.</hi> They are Inferior Evils admit of Tears, but thoſe of a Superior Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are unexpreſſible. When <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State, King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt</hi> are partakers of one and the ſame Calamity; what moderation can be expected in our Elegiack Threnes and Mournful Lamentations? For where can we find words to expreſs the Conflicts and Agonies of our Souls? Yet ſtill the misfortunes are far greater, which give occaſion to this lamentation in the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> for when the <hi>Amali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kite</hi> had told them the pitiful and fatal overthrow of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> Army, then the Text tells us, <hi>They Mourned, and Wept, and Faſted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:191991:7"/>
            <p>Mourning, Weeping and Faſting were the Dutiful, as well as Holy Performances of all pertaining to the Family of <hi>David,</hi> and ought not that to be this days chief work in the Houſes of us all?

                  <p>Thus fell that ſhining Star, whoſe Light over-ſpread the whole Earth, and the Royal Dignity Suffer'd an Eclipſe in the Greateſt King that ever was.</p>

If <hi>Sauls</hi> death was ſo deplorable, (yet he a wicked Perſon, and the <hi>Phyliſtines</hi> none of his Subjects) then how much more in this caſe, where wicked Subjects, Subjects ſaid I?

                  <p>How ought this to afflict us? <hi>Know you not that there is a Prince, a great man fallen this day in our</hi> Iſrael — He is fallen, and his fall accompanied with that of the Nobility and Gentry, Laws and Juſtice, with the fall of Church and Religion, Doctrine and Diſcipline, Piety and Morality; let us Mourn then that our ſins of Scarlet may be made white by the Blood of Chriſt. I am charitably perſwaded, all in this Aſſembly did deteſt this Bloody Action with the greateſt Horrour and Indignation: Nevertheleſs we muſt all acknowledge our ſelves guilty of his Blood, becauſe they were our ſins, the ſins of the whole Nation, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God to thunder down Vengeance on us in the Perſon of our Shepherd, that ſo we, the ſheep might be ſmitten. It was of thy Mercy, O Lord, thy Mercy alone, O praiſed be that Mercy! That we were not utterly conſumed, when for many years together, our Cornutes were turned into Fifes, our Dances into Marches, and our Banquets into want of Bread, and our Livery-Gowns into Buff-Coats, and our Suits of Gold into Glittering Armour, and our Beavers into Hemlets? How was the Pride of our Cupboard, and our Fingers Glory, turned into Soldiers Sallaries, and the price of Blood? How were our Girdles turned into Belts, and our Gowns and Caſſocks, into Coats of Mail? Our Lofty Houſes into Garriſons, and our ſtately Edifices into Priſons, our Temples into Stables, and the Houſe the Lord, the Houſe of Prayer, into a Den of Theeves?</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the Lords Anointed was ſlain, the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion went diſorderly, and proved out of Courſe; when our Prince of Peace, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, was taken from among us, then preſently ſprung up Briars and Brambles, more Cruel than Tigers, that rifled from Drams of Silver into the Bowels of their own fleſh, and would either Kill, or Die, for a days Wages; no ſooner was Soveraignty dethroned, and Majeſty deſtroyed, but Deſolation and Wo, with the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:191991:12"/>whole retinue of Miſeries fell upon us; Inſomuch, we no ſooner ſat down to Meat, but we expected the intruſion of Armed Gueſts; how often were men dragg'd from their Beds to the Priſon, and from thence to an untimely and violent Death? And as it fared with the State, ſo alſo with the Church? How did their little Diſputes and Diviſions hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the building of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> They contended ſo long about the Windows, they had almoſt loſt the foundation for <hi>Sion,</hi> how did a pretence of inward Sanctity in ſome, devour their outward Decency! Pretending the Glory of God by ſuch means as you would think your ſelves Villified and affronted! How was Charity baniſh'd to fetch home Truth, and a Coal from the Altar to ſet the Temple it ſelf on Fire? When men pretended to be Enlightned by the Spirit, yet lived after the Luſts of the Fleſh? Were not thouſands made naked to keep the Surplice off from a few mens backs? How were the Churches defaced for the little Piques men conceited at the Windows, every minuit diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made a quarrel, and did not Diſputes raiſed about a Pin or Nail of the Temple, ſhake and endanger the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick thereof? Men took up the Weapons of the Devil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſhew of the Lords Cauſe; and pretending to fight the Battles of the Lord, they entred a Solemn <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and Swore <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the Prince of Darkneſs! How was Chriſtian Religion at once violated and defamed? Not only by violating her Precepts, but by falſly aſperſing her, to own, and countenance ſuch vitious practices: Theſe with many more Miſeries did our Nation groan under ſo ſoon as we had committed that horrid crime of Regicide; and what could we expect leſs! <hi>Shall</hi> Zimri <hi>have Peace, who ſlew his Maſter?</hi> The King is Gods Vicegerent and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative on Earth, and therefore every Contempt of him is no leſs an affront to God himſelf? We read in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. That when the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſmitten three
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:191991:12"/>years together with Famine, the Oracle of God declared, <hi>That it was for</hi> Saul <hi>and his bloody houſe, becauſe he ſlew the</hi> Gibeonites. Now, I pray tell me, was not our National ſin, far greater than that of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s! There, it is true, the King ſlew the ſlaves, but here the ſlaves ſlew the King; there one of the worſt of Kings, contrary to a National Oath ſlew the baſeſt of the People; but here the baſeſt of the People, contrary to many Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, Proteſtations and Covenants, ſlew the beſt of Kings?</p>
                  <p>And will not God viſit for theſe things? Will our ſins be leſs importunate for Vengeance than that of the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> Shall the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Blood cry unto God from the ground, and will not the Blood of this days Martyr cry under the Altar? <hi>How long, O Lord, how long before thou avengeſt my Blood!</hi> Yes verily, and I am afraid, that beſides theſe many Plagues and Miſchiefs we have groaned under, there be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Vengeance hanging over us, his hand will be ſtretched out ſtill, unleſs we prevent it by a ſerious Confeſſion, and a ſincere Repentance of our Sins; when we were in the dregs of Miſery, and lying under the bitterneſs of Death, Heaven ſmiled upon us, and the great and all-ſeeing Eye gave us a taſt of his Mercies, by Reſtoring unto us our Dread Soveraign; But examine your Conſciences, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of your Hearts, what Gratitude you expreſs for this Mercy? What returns have we made for ſo aſtoniſhing a Bleſſing? We entertain'd the Change with a Joy too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, but was it enough Religious? We ſaw the great things were done for us, whereof we were glad, but did we ſo much conſider, the Lord had done them, and were we not more affected with the variety and profitableneſs, than with the Mercy and kindneſs of the Diſpenſation? Have we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly humbled our ſelves before God for this days Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs? Have we Repented of it, have we diſpatched our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:191991:13"/>Tears and Sighs as Embaſſadors from Heaven to plead in our behalf, and to Sue out our Pardon? That you and I, and all of us are Guilty of the Sin, is ſufficiently notorious, though after divers manners and circumſtances; as then the Diſtemper is Epidemical, ſo let our Sorrow be Univerſal; let us unanimouſly cry unto God, that he wou'd forgive us not only this, but all the ſins we have ſince committed, for God hath applyed the Sun-ſhine of his Mercies to melt us into Repentance, as well as the Thunder of his Judgments to ruffle us into Obedience; but let us ſeriouſly reflect, if the Oyl of his Mercy hath not made us rather wanton and nimble in Feaſts of Impiety, than Active in his Service? And as we have abuſed his Favours, ſo neither hath his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſtructed us to learn Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>O curſed Impenitency for this days Murther!

                  <p>Speak, O Royal <hi>Charles,</hi> Was it not thy Blood which brought the moſt flouriſhing and famous City in the World to Ruine and Deſolation, overthrowing it, as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> were overthrown; and have we yet made an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement to thy Hearſe? Are we not ſtill inſenſible of our Wickedneſs? Have we watered our Couch with Tears for this our Diſloyalty? Have we pay'd double Honour unto the Son for the great Diſhonour done unto the Father? 'Tis true we have Sanctified a Faſt, and called a Solemn
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:191991:13"/>Aſſembly; but have we Faſted from our Sins? Is there not as much Rebellion in our Hearts, as before we expreſt in our Actions? Are we not dayly Contriving and Plotting the Subverſion of our Government? How do we make our ſelves a Prey to our Adverſaries by the Diviſions amongſt us; by our Heading of Factions, and Eſpouſing little Parties and Intereſts? Do we not dayly Speak Evil of Dignities, and Deſpiſe Principalities and Powers? Though, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall ſay unto a King, what doſt thou?</hi> And thou ſhalt not Speak Evil of the Ruler of thy People; do we not contemn his Laws, and refuſe the Dictates of his Precepts, and will not the Noiſe of Blood pull Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon our Heads, if we prove no better Penitents. Yes verily, and I am afraid the Calamitous Diſtractions which at this day Infect our Nation, proceedeth from our little reſpect to this days Solemnity: Many, inſtead of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Praying, are Hectoring and Ranting; and if this be the Religion of Saints, tell me, O good God! what is the Impiety of Devils? Is it Comely thus to Mourn in Coloured Taffaty? Will ſuch a wreſtling with God force him to a Bleſſing, or rather will it not provoke Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven, utterly to undoe us? <hi>I will up, I will up,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and eaſe my ſelf of my Adverſaries, making my Sword like that of</hi> Saul, <hi>or</hi> Gideon, <hi>loaden with the Blood of the ſlain, and Fat of the mighty:</hi> Yet ſtill as if God only ſpoke big Words, and all his Threats were meer Bravadoes of Heaven, we ſlight and condemn both his Golden Scepter and Iron Rod.</p>
                  <p>Alas! was ever People ſo Prodigiouſly beſotted, as to think, God will be thus infinitely provoked? Let us begin then now to fear our God, and to pay all Honour and reſpect to the Defender of his Faith; are you not acquainted that our Nation is almoſt ruin'd and deſtroyed; doth not Church and State lye a Bleeding? are not your Eſtates waſted?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:191991:14"/>and your Trading decay'd? Your Splendor Eclipſed? Your Families broken and ſcattered; yea, and your Dignities trampled on: Is it not high time then that we fall on our knees, and beg of God that the Blood of his Son, may cleanſe us from that of our Soveraign? Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die? If we ſeek unto God by Repentance, he will repent of the Evil he intended to inflict upon us: Oh! bleſſed Repentance, it is Thou alone that canſt ſave us! It was Thou alone, O Repentance, that ſaved Eight Perſons from the Flood. <hi>Nineveh</hi> had fallen, had not you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it, it had fallen, had not you protected it; it was the want of Thee that cauſed the Deſtruction of <hi>Egypt:</hi> If Thou hadſt been preſent, <hi>Sodom</hi> had not been deſtroyed: Come thou then to our ſuccour, O potent Repentance, help us, O help us! Thou Joy of Angels and Crown of Nations, ſtand up in defence of a no longer Rebellious, but Penitent People; let a poor Bleeding Church, let a poor Periſhing Nation take ſhelter under thy Wings: Turn in unto us O Repentance, and be Thou viſible in this Nation, who art only able to repair the miſchiefs thereof: Make us perfect <hi>Ninevites,</hi> that the cry of Blood may not be laid to our Charge; give us from henceforth Loyally affected Hearts, that we may be ſubject not only for Wrath, but for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake; Cloath us with Sack-cloath, that we may not be ſtript of our Gorgeous Apparel; Sprinkle us with Aſhes that the Smell of Fire may be no longer in our Dwellings; Enjoyn us to Faſt for <hi>Saul</hi> and for <hi>Jonathan,</hi> that we may live in Peace, and enjoy the Fruits of our Labour in all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Honeſty; make us to Cry mightily, that no other Cry may be heard in our Streets than thoſe of Devotion; for Bleſſed are the People that are in ſuch a Caſe; yea, Bleſſed are the People who have the Lord for their God. For then ſhall Peace be within our Walls, and Plentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within our Pallaces, then ſhall there be no complaining nor leading into Captivity in our Streets.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:191991:14"/>
                  <p>Oh! the Happineſs we might enjoy if we were thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious for our own good; and if not now, when ſhall we be Happy? When we live under ſo Gracious a Prince, that for Virtue ond Piety he is Second to none but <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, but none but <hi>Apelles</hi> can draw <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Picture. I ſhall conclude therefore, Humbly beſeeching God to grant Him a long and Proſperous Reign over us, to Confound the ſubtile Conſpiracies of His Enemies, and that as he hath expreſt His Grace and Clemency to us, ſo may we blot out the Infamy of this Day, by plentiful returns of our Sincere Loyalty and Affection to Him; and let all Loyal and Well Affected Subjects ſay, from the bottom of their Hearts,</p>
                  <p>

            <p>THe moſt convenient Place for Judgement, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the Houſe of God; for there is no danger of miſcarriages in the Commonwealth, when there is a concurrence of all things to promote the Beauty and Glory of the Temple: For wherein conſiſts the Glory of a Kingdom? But in the due Execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: And what is it that Maintains the Queen upon her Throne? But the Power of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:191991:16"/>
            <p>When Religion then begins to faulter, no marvail if Juſtice begins to ſwerve; and what can that preſage, but he eminent peril and downfal of a State?</p>
            <p>To prevent therefore the ruines and devaſtations of both, God hath intruſted the Royal Office with an Abſolute Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, and depoſited the Court Rolls of Heaven into his Hands: For the ſame Divine Providence that Anoints Him King, Proclaims Him alſo <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and great Nurſing Father of the Church.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple of the Lord and his own Pallace both together, but he firſt Perfected the goodly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the former, before he began to Erect the latter, to hint to us that it is the Temple which faſtens the Royal Diadem upon the Princes Brows.</p>
            <p>Though we urge not therefore the great Aid and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the Crown by thoſe weapons of the Church, <hi>Praeces &amp; lacrimae.</hi> Yet Heaven hath ſo provided, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> is as much obliged out of kindneſs to Himſelf, (as a Religious reſpect to promote the Splendour of Religion;) to take ſpecial regard that the Houſe of Prayer be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a den of Theeves.</p>
            <p>For he who will abuſe the Houſe of God, will even dare to Affront Majeſty to His Face.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Aaron</hi> be diſturbed in his Office, how can <hi>Moſes</hi> be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in his Throne, or how can <hi>Aaron</hi> be a Co-adjutor and Prophet unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> if he be not a Shield and Defence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Brother? The Intereſt of the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Miter, Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Croſier</hi> is mutually to aſſiſt each other; for, like Twins, they thrive and fade, live and die together: And as the Proſperity of a Kingdom, depend on the flouriſhing of Religion; ſo likewiſe Religion muſt uſe the Rules of Diſcipline to make it more vigorous and Powerful.</p>
            <p>The Primitive Fathers, as well as thoſe of a younger birth, imployed all their Induſtry and Care for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:191991:16"/>of it. 'Tis all one, like the <hi>Edomite,</hi> to race and demoliſh the Church, as with Separatiſts to inveigh againſt the Diſcipline thereof. The Apoſtolical Cannons largely evince the Pains and Induſtry the Apoſtles uſed to maintain its Honour and Glory; they therefore Decreed that Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Aſſemblies ſhould be held twice every year; which Conſtitutions were afterwards re-inforced by the Decrees of ſeveral Councils: For what was more Powerful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Sanctity, maintain Purity of Doctrine, hinder <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and to encourage the Diſpencers of Gods Word, to contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints?</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore a Duty incumbent on the Biſhop, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that Diſcipline be preſerved in the Church, and to Actuate thoſe Laws, which otherwiſe would die Abortive They therefore who declaim againſt <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Biſhops, ſtrike at the very ground and Foundation of the Church. For let us but remove Prelacy, and tell me where ſhall we find Diſcipline; and that being gone, what will become of Religion? When Anarchy reigned in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then every man did what ſeemed good in his own eyes; and where there is no Prelate, are there not diverſity of Doctrines, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Judgements, and every man profeſſing what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he pleaſeth? But ſeeing there are Biſhops in our Church, if there be not a Religious and Orthodox Clergy, where lyes the fault but in the Prelate; and if there be not a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and Conformable People, where lyes the Fault but in the Prieſt? For where they are ſtrict and careful in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duties incumbent on them, the People would or muſt of neceſſity do theirs?</p>
            <p>It was upon this account, therefore the Bleſſed Jeſus in this Chapter, <hi>When he ſaw the City he wept of over it; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into the Temple, he caſt out them who Sold therein.</hi>

            <p>In all his time of Converſe with mankind on Earth, he never executed the Office of a Magiſtrate till now; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, what place more fit for Reformation to begin in? Were all Erronious, <hi>Whiggiſh</hi> and half-Conforming perſons weeded out of all Eccleſiaſtical Courts and Imployments, we ſhould ſoon find <hi>Religion</hi> would have a greater Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the Conformity and Lives of Men. May we not well preſume <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be out of Courſe, and Order, when there were ſuch great Diſorders in the Houſe of God? When Theeves and Robbers had taken the Houſe of God in Poſſeſſion, and Sacriledge inſtalled in the Houſe of Prayer? Here then our Saviour begins, paſſing by the Sins and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the City, <hi>only weeping over it,</hi> and pittying it; but puniſhing the ſins of the Temple, for he Whipped and Scourged them who had Prophan'd it; ſaying, <hi>My Houſe ſhall be called the Houſe of Prayer.</hi> The words preſent to us the Inſtitution, and Prophanation of the Church of God, <hi>My Houſe,</hi> &amp;c, The Inſtitution will entertain your Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with three Particulars. <hi>What it muſt be, For whom, And for what end.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>We reſume the Firſt,</hi> It muſt be an Houſe.</head>
               <p>Firſt, Though the Earth is the Lords, and the Fulneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Though God be the Supreme Governour of all the World, and cannot be circumſcribed, but repleniſh every Corner and part thereof with his Preſence; yet ſtill he hath ever confined himſelf to ſome one particular place, ſet apart for his Adoration and Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Though as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Men ought to Pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and in every place:</hi> Nevertheleſs in all Ages of the World, God hath appointed ſome more peculiar Place for his Royal Court, and Refidence on Earth, where Men ſhall offer Sacrifices of Prayer, and Praiſes to him.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:191991:17"/>
               <p>Thus when Religion was but in its Infancy, God was reſorted to in a remote Mountain, or ſome neighbouring Grove, where being abſent from the noiſes of the World, men might elevate their Souls in the moſt pleaſant Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of Eternity; where they may be freed from all Avocations, having no incumbrances to Indiſpoſe their Minds from ſetting their Affections on things above.</p>
               <p>It was in this Melancholly Solitude and Holy Retirement from the World that <hi>Abraham,</hi> Solicited God by Invocation. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.33.</p>
               <p>But when Religion began to flouriſh, theſe Groves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abuſed by Gentile Superſtition, God removed himſelf into a Tabernacle, and journey'd along with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and would not be publickly ſpoke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all until <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time. When theſe Pilgrims had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated their Travels, God no longer dwelt in a Tabernacle or Travelling Temple, but had an Houſe Erected, that He and the Ark of his Strength might enter therein; and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> was the firſt who built this Houſe where Men ſhould make their Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>Nor ever read I any denying him a place to reſt in, till there ſtarted up a late Generation of men, who would make God but their In-mate, and out of Civil Courteſie grant him a Lodging, like the poor <hi>Levite</hi> in <hi>Micha's</hi> Houſe, or the man of God in the <hi>Shunamites</hi> little Chamber. But Sirs, God commands me to declare, That he who provides us an Houſe to ſecure us againſt the ruggedneſs of the Air, and fierceneſs of Beaſts, will have an Houſe Dedicated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he may dwell therein; yea, and Bleſſed be God we have found out an Habitation for the Lord of Hoſts, But Thanks to the Devotion of our Fore-fathers. For we are more ready to pull down than to build; and if ſo, how great is our backwardneſs to Beautify and Adorn; good Works are even Antiquated; and that Religion adjudged moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:191991:18"/>to God. which is the leaſt chargable to man 'Tis ſtrange men ſhould be ſo baſely nigardly in promoting the Glory of God? Either there muſt be leſs Religion in the World, or not the ſame Obligation; the laſt is impoſſible, for the Glory of God which prompted our Fore-fathers, hath the ſame force and Argument upon us; it muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed from our low eſteem of an Omnipotent Being, that we imagine a Granary or Stable, or ſome Spiritual <hi>Weavers</hi> Parlour, ſpacious enough to entertain the King of Glory, and all his retinue of Celeſtial Courtiers.</p>
               <p>We are cenſured Superſtitious, if we be not direct Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes to the Pious Senſe of former Ages: We are preſently concluded devoted to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> if we be but ſo Curious as to make Gods Houſe Handſomer than our own; But if this be Superſtition, I wiſh from the bottom of my Soul, all men were thus Superſtitious, and zealous of good Works; If this be Superſtition, how had it over-ſpread and corrupted Primitive Chriſtianity? For they thought no Service ſo acceptable, as to do ſomething for Gods Houſe? For what is more plain, men have but ſmall reſpect for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who adorn their Houſes with Marble and Ivory, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar and Tapeſtry, and ſee Gods Houſe lie unprovided for, and neglected? Whatever men think, the Royal Prophet I am ſure was of another Judgement and Perſwaſion: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Nathan</hi>) <hi>ſee now I dwell in a Houſe of Ceder, but the Ark of God reſteth within Curtains.</hi> He thought it great Ir-religion and Impiety, that even the Kings Pallace ſhould be more Glorious than Gods Houſe: This was the primary reaſon Antiquity Chriſtened their Churches by the Name of <hi>Baſilicae,</hi> not becauſe they there Sacrificed to the King of Heaven and Earth, but becauſe of their Beauty and Frame. How Magnificent and Noble was the Temple which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> Erected; and yet how far ſurpaſſed, by that vaſt one <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his Son built at <hi>Alexandria?</hi> He
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:191991:18"/>ſucceeded his Father, not only in poſſeſſing the ſame Religion, but alſo in his great Care and Reverence for the Houſe of God: For they two are inſeparable Companions; he can't have any high regard for Religion, who diſ-regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Houſe of the Lord; let that fall, and Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand; let that decay, and will not Religion periſh? He who hath any reſpect for his Maſter, can't patiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Houſe ſurmounted by an Hoſpital, or Almes-Houſe, for Beauty and Ornament? Can my Devotions be Elevated and Pure, when I ſee the place where he dwels, more like a <hi>Bridewel,</hi> or Peſt-houſe, than the Pallace of my God? Can we conceive it the preſence-Chamber of Heaven, where God and his whole train of Bleſſed Spirits are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preſent to hear and obſerve us when we ſee it more like a Stye, or a Stable, rather than the Manſion of ſo Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Being; And this I fear, is no ſmall occaſion, men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themſelves ſo unhandſomſly and rudely therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an ordinary Cottage out-vies it in Spruceneſs, and Neatneſs. But indeed the moſt Graceful Ornament of an Houſe, is the Peace and Unity therein; And for this Cauſe, I preſume the Church is not ſtiled <hi>Curia,</hi> but <hi>Domus;</hi> not a Court where Diviſions and Envy are nouriſhed, but an Houſe where Righteouſneſs and Truth meet together, and Love and Peace even Kiſs each other. 'Tis no eaſie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to maintain perfect Unity in a State, but is it ſo labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to preſerve it in an Houſe? The Diſturbances and Commotions of a Kingdom, may prove Dangerous, and Fatal, but are not the Diviſions of an Houſe far more oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious and ſhameful? When men are not of one mind in an Houſe, but the Father oppoſing the Son, and the Son ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to controll the Father. The Church ought to be an Houſe in reſpect of the Unity and Order maintained therein, but not an Houſe divided againſt it ſelf, where the Paſtor is againſt the People, and the People endeavouring
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:191991:19"/>to oppoſe the Shepherd, and both joyn hand in hand to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne their Biſhop and Ordinary. They who conſented to the perſwaſion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> were of opinion, that there was but one God, and two Devils, becauſe he firſt ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Unity. I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they alledged to prove their Aſſertion, but I am veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, the Devil was the firſt <hi>Whigg,</hi> (in its proper ſenſe,) Who not only by his ſaucy Affectation of a Parity with God, cauſed a Diviſion and Tumult in Heaven; but alſo, he ſtill hath his Agents and Factors to create the like differences upon Earth; he can't, it's true, now ſtain the Glories of unblemiſh'd Saints, or ſet Heaven it ſelf at odds: Yet alas! How Proſperous is he, in ſomenting Enmities, Animoſities and Diviſions upon Earth: Was it not the Devil, who cauſed the <hi>Schiſm</hi> of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram?</hi> Did not he breed the ſeparation of the <hi>Euſtaſians,</hi> who occaſioned the Councel at <hi>Gangra?</hi> Was it not he, who En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled that <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> Fire of the <hi>Donatiſts?</hi> Did not he blow it into ſuch diſmall and raging Flames, that they had almoſt conſumed and burnt the whole Church? Yea, even turn'd it into Aſhes? Had not that Councel at <hi>Africa</hi> been Aſſembled to quench and allay its fury; And tell me, I beſeech you, are not theſe Embers reviv'd afreſh? If we reflect on thoſe, who at this day diſturb our <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are they not of the ſame dye and Complexion (herein only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) that thoſe of this Age have ſcrap'd the ſhreds of all old and out-worn <hi>Hereſies</hi> to patch them up in a <hi>Scotch</hi> Tump, or <hi>Geneva</hi> Frock; but God grant, all the <hi>Tantivy-men</hi> (as they maliciouſly call us) and Obedient Sons of the Church, may unanimouſly concur to whip and ſcourge out all them, who foment and cheriſh the Diviſions of Church or State; that the Houſe of Prayer may no longer be a Den, but an Houſe, and that for God too, which is the next particular.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:191991:19"/>
               <p>Secondly, My Houſe, and upon this account it was ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Councel at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> where they Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned even the Feaſts of Charity celebrated therein; for though they were good convincing Arguments of Chriſtian Unity and Love; and held the Authority of Apoſtolical Cuſtom, yet ſtill it was thought great Prophanation of the Temple, becauſe it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, proper only to God, and not to be imployed to uſes of our own. God gives us a right and propriety to all others, but this is Gods Houſe, and we may not make bold with it? For as it hath a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Holineſs, ſo in like manner, a ſpecial Honour pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto: We don't, it is true, conſider it as Holy in reſpect of it ſelf, yet is it not Holy by reaſon of its uſe, and ſpecial dedication unto God? And if ſo, how Erroneous are they, who diſpute againſt it, and maintain any other place as much his, and as much Holy? Which, if true, to what end is that ſtrict Command, <hi>Make not my Fathers Houſe an Houſe of Merchandiſe?</hi> Or how could our Saviour lay Sacriledge to the <hi>Jews</hi> charge, becauſe they Traded and Traficked there?</p>
               <p>What more evident, than that the Churches are to be uſed only for the Services of God? And that ought to be the principle, yea only end of our coming thither, and not to diſpatch Worldly concerns, to make Compacts and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, as too frequent amongſt us.</p>
               <p>The Conſecration and Dedication of Churches is no new nor unheard of thing, no nor yet Superſtitious; they who cenſure it ſo, caſt dirt upon all Holy Antiquity: Ah! of Holy Antiquity, ſaid I; in the very face of God himſelf, who hath ever Honoured and Accepted it.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Conſecration thereof, makes it Holy; yea, and cauſeth God ſo to judge of it: For though Stone and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are incapable of Grace; yet by their Conſecration, they receive a Spiritual Power, whereby they are made fit
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:191991:20"/>for Gods Worſhip and Service. Now being Conſecrated, tell me, O tell me the danger of Attributing Holineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? I am confident there is none, if we will not run con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in Opinion to the whole ſtream and current of the Ancient Fathers, who declared it as their Judgment? Whence, O whence, comes that rude and unhandſom Behaviour in the Church (that he muſt have a piercing judgment indeed who can diſcern a difference between the Temple and the Theatre) but from that <hi>Heretical</hi> Opinion condemned in the <hi>Meſſalian Hereticks,</hi> that there is no more Holineſs in the one than in the other? Does not the Profane Uſage proceed from the Profane Opinion thereof? And he that conceived thus, what can he be ſtiled leſs than <hi>Atheiſt</hi> or <hi>Heretick?</hi> For let us have but an Honourable Opinion of God, and from the Hem of ſuch a Garment will flow a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Honourable Opinion of his Houſe: Let us but Honour him, and I declare it impoſſible to have no Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Reverence for the Temple.</p>
               <p>Let others ſtile it Superſtitious, but O my Soul come not thou into their Secrets, but mount up thy ſelf, and imitate the Devotions of Primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who Worſhipped God toward the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> both <hi>Prieſt</hi> and People as ſoon as they preſented themſelves in his Houſe: All the time they were there, with what Modeſty and Silence, with what Reverence and Attention did they demean themſelves? That it juſtly merited the Phraiſe of the Houſe of God, and they of a Choire of Angels rather than Men: Were they not all upon their Knees at the Prayers? All upon their Feet at the Sermon; none preſuming to Sit, as being too bold and laiſy a Poſture in the Houſe of God? Nay, were there not ſome, who, <hi>Audipedes incedebant in Templum.</hi> In imitation of <hi>Moſes</hi> they would not have their Shooes on their Feet in the Temple. May not this ſhame; yea, God grant it riſe not up in Judegment againſt them who Snort a Sleep in his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:191991:20"/>Houſe, as if they had not a Cabin to reſt in? Who have their Hatts on their Heads, when God and his Angels more immediately behold them? And what O ye Watchmen of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Prophets of the Lord, ſhall we ſee our Maſter thus Diſhonoured in his Houſe, and ſhall we wink at the Abuſes? Let us not be ſo faint-hearted and tame, as if we were afraid to Speak; but let us labour to maintain the Glory of his Houſe? Ought there to be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Temple of the Lord and an Houſe accuſtomed to Revelling? Shall a common Meeting place in the Market, and that of Angels and Arch-Angels be one and the ſame? Of Angels ſaid I? yea, the very Preſence Chamber of the King of Heaven.</p>
               <p>This is a Duty eſpecially incumbent on the <hi>Prieſt</hi> to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſuch Abuſes and miſcarriages in the Church; that it may not be a Den, but ever continue an Houſe of Prayer.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Which is the next Particular.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, Though there be many Religious Duties to be exerciſed in the Houſe of God, yet Prayer is the principal; yea, no other is mentioned. Gods Houſe is the Houſe of Prayer, not of Preaching; not that Preaching is excluded, but Prayer muſt have the preheminence and upper-hand. Preaching and Prayer are both good, but of the two the the latter is the moſt worthy; 'tis pity two ſuch fair Siſters ſhould vie Beauty; but indeed God hath commanded me to declare that Prayer muſt have the moſt eminent, nay on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, <hi>My Houſe is the Houſe of Prayer.</hi> This was the Apoſtles judgement, when there was the higheſt neceſſity for Preaching, for then the Goſpel was to be planted in all the World; nevertheleſs though it was then moſt uſeful, yet Prayer was preferred before it, for ſay the Apoſtles, <hi>But we will give our ſelves continually unto Prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the Word,</hi> Acts 6.4. Firſt Prayer, then the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:191991:21"/>Miniſtry of the Word; now if it was ſo in their days, the Argument is more forcible in ours, becauſe the Goſpel is propagated, and Chriſtianity fully ſettled among us; God forbid that I ſhould in the leaſt derogate from that Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Imployment of Preaching the Word, yet I am more then convinced we muſt more ſtrictly account for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Prayer than of Preaching: Yet alas! we think we may be remiſs in our Duty of coming to Church, if our Ears be not firſt alarm'd with the loud noiſes of a Sermon Bell, as if Religion conſiſted in this only, and went no higher than <hi>aurium Tenus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To what end ſerves Preaching, and all Learned Diſcourſes, but as Inſtruments and means to inſtruct us to Pray; Thus you may hear St. <hi>Paul, How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how ſhall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> So that Preaching is the means to direct us to call upon him: And I pray tell me, if the means ought to be magnified beyond the end?</p>
               <p>The Fathers, 'tis true, were very frequent in ſuch Pious Orations, but this did not make Prayer more compendious; for in the days of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> when Preaching was moſt uſed, there was no part of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> omitted, but now Prayer is ſlenderly reſpected; we ſeem deſirous of nothing but Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Many mens diſlike to that incomparable <hi>Common Prayer</hi> practiced in the Church, Pardon me Gentlemen if I impute it to thoſe of our Function; for how can we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Laity to have Reverence for it, when we our ſelves ſeem to diſown it, by cutting it into little ſhreds and parts, either to oblige a Faction, or eaſe our ſelves; But did we all unanimouſly agree to be obedient to our <hi>Rubrick,</hi> as our Oath requires us, men would ſoon have a greater reſpect for It and Us; for what can create greater Diſtractions in the minds of men, whilſt they obſerve me exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:191991:21"/>to the Rules of the Church, and another little or nothing regarding it, for the ſame Obligation commands it from him, which enjoyns it as my Duty. The <hi>Roman</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votionals ('tis true) retain a great part of our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and do they not alſo the ſame Bible, Sacraments, and other Holy Duties, and ſhall I deny that which is good, becauſe it hath ſometimes been mixed with Evil? The Veſſels of the Temple were carried to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Prophaned by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,</hi> yet were they not reſtored, and Conſecrated by <hi>Ezra</hi> to the Service of God? The <hi>Common Prayer-Book</hi> in like manner was moſt collected from the <hi>Roman Maſs Book,</hi> but what of this? There were <hi>Liturgies</hi> extant in the Church before the <hi>Maſs</hi> had Name, or Being; and <hi>Rome Chriſtian,</hi> was much Elder than that of <hi>Papal:</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Miſtery of Iniquity began to play its Cards, the Old or Firſt <hi>Common Prayer</hi> was not Aboliſhed, only mixed with Errors and Corruptions; which blemiſhes being taken away, is it not as Beautiful as ever? This then was the Pious Care of our firſt Reformers to refine it from its Droſs, and bring it to its Primitive Purity, retaining nothing but what is pure Scripture, or deducted there-from by the Judegment of our Holy Mother the Church. But alas! we ſo much degenerate from their Worthyneſs, that we will not follow the form preſcribed by them; we are for new Lights and Inventions to guide us to Heaven, we deny <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and magnifie the ſudden Raptures of men, as the Illuminations of the Spirit; when really what are they better, than an heap of Non-ſenſe in Crampt words, only glazed with the Saint-like Varniſhes of a caſt up Eye, and Canting Tone.</p>
               <p>Their chief Objections againſt the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> are becauſe it is a Form, and enforced by Authority, which are ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, they are not worthy Confutation: For what Prayers I pray beſt adorn the Beauty of Holineſs, thoſe which are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:191991:22"/>ſhuffled together by Chance, or ſuch as be Refined and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, who Pray moſt Believingly, he who digeſteth what he Prays for? or he who utters his firſt Senſe and Thoughts? Who Prays with fulleſt aſſurance to have his Prayers heard and Crown'd with Succeſs? He who weighs and ponders his Petitions? Or he who either by implicite Devotion gives aſſent to all that proceed from the mouth of a Gifted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or elſe ſuſpend his <hi>Amen,</hi> when he hears things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his reaſon, or rule of Faith? So that it cannot be becauſe it is a Form, but becauſe commanded by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; yet that very command layes the higheſt Obligation for our Obedience thereto. <hi>Obedience</hi> (ſays <hi>Samuel</hi>) <hi>is better than Sacrifice.</hi> The <hi>Levitical</hi> Law Commanded, <hi>That the Firſtlings of an Aſs ſhould be redeemed with a Lamb:</hi> Now, ſhall we in contempt of this Law, break the Lambs neck, and think an Aſs a more proper Offering for the Temple?</p>
               <p>Return then O <hi>Shunamite,</hi> return, return into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of thy Holy Mother the Church, for ſhe is all Fair, there is no Spot in her; ſhe looked forth as the Morning, Fair as the Moon, Cleer as the Sun, and Terrible as an Army with Banners. The Prophanation of the Church, <hi>Ye have made it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That which was before phraiſed the Perfection of Beauty, the Joy of the whole Earth; whether the Tribes aſcended, as to the Patern of Heaven: When Chriſt came to viſit it, it was neither like Heaven nor an Houſe, the very Sacrifices therein had need of an Expiation; the Sanctuary it ſelf could not be ſafe from Sacrilegious Cruelty, God and Prayer were both driven out by Theeves. The Temple was not barely Prophaned, but Prophaned in the moſt hainous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the greatneſs of the Offence, may be meaſured by the harſhneſs of the Term, in that he calls not an Houſe, but a Den, <hi>Ye have made,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Where I ſhall conſider,</hi> When the Church is made a Den: <hi>And then ſecondly,</hi> Who are the Theeves.</head>

               <p>For Firſt, If the Light of Ceremonies be taken out of the Church, we blow out the Light that is ſhining therein;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</note> is not Senſe the guide to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding! Do not Viſible things direct us to thoſe that are Inviſible? Can an Internal Worſhip be manifeſted better than by an External Deportment? All Nations, not only <hi>Jews</hi> but <hi>Gentiles,</hi> had Rites in the Adorations of their ſuppoſed Deities. All meeting in this, as a Principle of Nature, that Divine Worſhip cannot be rightly Celebrated without ſome Outward Solemnity.</p>
               <p>Did not God command the uſe of Ceremonies unto the <hi>Jews?</hi> Now the Moral and Ceremonial Law were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated at different times, but both together, <hi>And thoſe whom God hath joyned, let no man put aſunder.</hi> Will it not cauſe a Diſ-reſpect to hear the Service of God hudl'd over, as a Scrivener reads a Bond or an Indenture: Are we ſo great Enemies to Innocency, that a Surplice ſhould afright us from attending the Ordinances of God? That the Prieſt ſhould <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was ſo general a practice in all Ages of the Church, that none did Officiate in Holy Offices, but he was clad in Raiment White as Snow.</p>
               <p>They are not the Embroideries of Religion I ſo admire, as to have its Garment too heavy and weighty, nor ſuch a plainneſs,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:191991:23"/>as to abhor all Decency and Comlineſs; For let us ſuppoſe the worſt, that there are ſome Spots which may be ſpared, cou'd they be handſomly taken out, yet what? Becauſe of this muſt I rend my Garment in pieces and be naked? Or ſhall I ſuffer rude Hands to cut and tear it in pieces, as they pleaſe, to the great injury and Perturbation of the Church, <hi>Ceremoniae tanquam Cerei,</hi> They are as Lights which give Luſtre and Brightneſs to Gods Houſe, and the Services per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed there, and one way to make it a Den, is to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh this Light, that it may not give Light to them entring the Houſe of Prayer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the Church can't but be dark without Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, ſo if the Life of Doctrine requir'd in the Prieſt, be not a Lamp unto our Feet, and Light unto our Paths, to guide us into the wayes of Peace.</p>
               <p>The Bleſſed Jeſus himſelf hath ſtiled the Preachers of the Word, not only <hi>the Lights of the World,</hi> but alſo, <hi>the Salt of the Earth, a City ſet upon a Hill;</hi> they are not only Stars, but Angels, choſen Veſſels, men of a thouſand; their Feet are ſtiled Beautiful, and they themſelves the Glory of Chriſt; good reaſon then if our Lights ſhould ſhine before men, for ſeeing we are called to this Eminent Function, having the Title of Light attributed us; we cannot think it ſufficient we have Lamps unleſs furniſhed with Oyl, that our Doctrine may promote the Glory of God, and ſave both our own, and the Souls of them committed to our Care.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Prayer may be a Den, if the Flames there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be not real, but Painted.</p>
               <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Timothy, To take heed unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Doctrine, and put them in remembrance to ſtir up the Gift of God.</hi> 'Tis not enough to fill the Golden Candleſtick of the Temple, unleſs they give Light to thoſe that enter in; otherwiſe what are they more than prettily
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:191991:23"/>contrived Antickes under a Building, who ſeem to groan under the oppreſſion of that which doth ſupport them.</p>
               <p>'Twas our Saviours Command, <hi>That we ſhould always have our Loyns girt,</hi> (that is) with the Girdle of Sincerity and Truth, or with other Expoſitors, by External Conformity in our Habits; we muſt be Pillars of Fire to guide others out of the night of Ignorance and wilderneſs of Errour: For are not the Prieſts Lips to preſerve Knowledge, and are not we to enquire of them what concerns our Souls, for they are the Meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this, only minding you of that Solemn Oath at our Inſtallment into this Sacred Office, <hi>That we would give Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diligence to Miniſter the Doctrine and Diſcipline of Chriſt:</hi> For if the Lights of the Church be darkened, how great is that Darkneſs! And what will be the Houſe of Prayer but a Den, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As there muſt be the Light of Doctrine, ſo alſo of Converſation in the Prieſt; yes, and it muſt be Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous too, that <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Doctors</hi> thereof may have a good Report amongſt all men of whatever Sect or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that they may find no occaſion to Revile, or Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme us; Blaſpheme us I ſay, for in doing it unto us, they do it unto Chriſt; we have Motives ſufficient to incite us to a circumſpect walking; For, waving the expreſs command of our Saviour, let us conſider how many Enemies we have in the World, who watch for our Halting, and are ſo quick-ſighted, that they diſcern the leaſt Lint hanging on a Black-Gown: No Cloath ſo ſubject to be diſcoloured, as that of ours. Men are not like that Pious Emperour, who would co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Nakedneſs of his Clergy with his own Royal Robe, but joyful to embrace every little occaſion to render us Contemptible.</p>
               <p>This then ſhould awaken us; but if this will not do, let us conſider, how abſurd it is to undo that on the Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:191991:24"/>which we Preached on the Lords? Shall we be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in Inſtructing of others, and we our ſelves remain Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and Fooliſh? Shall we ſpeak brave flouriſhing words in commendation of Religion, and reclaim Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally againſt Vice; yet make it our Trade and Practice. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were both put into <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Breaſt-Plate, that he might be a Living Sermon, as well as a Preacher of Sound Doctrine.</p>
               <p>He who wanted an Eye, Hand, Foot, or had any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in his Body, was forbidden by God to attend at his Altar; then much more ſure polluted in Soul? They who bear the Veſſels of the Lord, muſt be Clean: <hi>Ye have made it a Den of Theeves,</hi> was a great aggravation of the Churches Prophanation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I deſcend to the Theeves, or Perſons defiling Gods Houſe: The firſt of them, is he who crept into the Miniſtry without Commiſſion; thus the Saviour of the World tells us, <hi>He who creeps into an Houſe by the Window, the ſame is a Theef and a Robber:</hi> And if ſo, what can he be ſtiled leſs who thruſts himſelf into the Prieſt-hood, and not by the door of Lawful Authority? Thus to run with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Commiſſion, is an Uſurpation of that which none ſhould take upon him, but he that was called of God as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> by an External, as well as Internal call. The Apoſtles were trained up a long time before Chriſt ſent them on that Employ; they were not ſent to Preach the Word ſo ſoon as they were Enrolled into the number of his Diſciples, like haſty Births with Shells upon their Heads, but they attended and waited for a full Authority and Commiſſion: But alas! Authority is now ſo much ſlighted and trampled on, that men fancy, if they can but ſpare ſo much time from their Shops, they have Authority enough to skip into the Office of the Prieſt; but are they not Theeves and Robbers, who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:191991:24"/>force themſelves into the Miniſtry without Licenſe, or Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities? they pretend indeed to a large ſhare of Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, which they reſume will ſupply all other Defects, and adapt them fit Miniſters of the Goſpel; which if true, the Houſe of Prayer would ſoon be made a Den of Theeves, for men would ſoon get the knack and Cunning, to pretend a Call; and then by tedious Diſcourſes of Gods Grace, ſo Inſinuate themſelves into the Boſoms of men, that they would eaſily be Deluded by them; others excuſe their Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate rudeneſs by the Honeſt, Plainneſs and Simplicity of the Apoſtles; but can they manifeſt ſuch Miraculous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, ſuch Power, and Anointing from above as they were furniſhed withall.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> in reference to this Holy Function, asked with trembling, <hi>Who is ſufficient for ſuch Offices?</hi> But they invert the queſtion, and cry, who is inſufficient? I leave it to your ſelves, is it probable that <hi>Farriers</hi> ſhould turn Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd <hi>Phyſitians;</hi> much leſs that they who come from ſordid Mechanick Offices, can provide for mens Souls? All accompliſhments of Reaſon, Learning and Judgement are decry'd as Carnal, and Enemies to the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt, which makes me commend to you the Story of the <hi>Apes</hi> in the Fable, <hi>Who becauſe they had no Tailes themſelves, would have perſwaded thoſe who enjoyed that Ornament to cut it off as troubleſome and ſuperfluous;</hi> your ſelves may make the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and ſo I paſs from the firſt to the ſecond ſort of Theeves who trouble the Houſe of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are thoſe who rob God of his Titles, for it is a groſs miſtake to think it is unto Us; no, it is unto God, they refuſe to render the things which are Gods; Thus you may hear God himſelf declare it, <hi>Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me;</hi> But you ſay wherein have we robbed Thee, in Tithes and Offerings? God takes the wrong whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto Himſelf, and the reaſon why he made the Heavens
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:191991:25"/>Braſs, and would not ſuffer Rain to deſcend upon the Earth, was becauſe they had given him no Tithes of the Fruits wherewith he had Bleſſed them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But as the People rob the Prieſt of his Tithes, ſo alſo the Prieſts rob the People in not affording them Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service: That the Prieſt ſhould reap mens Worldly things, is unqueſtionable; ſo it is alſo required that they ſhould reap our Spiritual things; If therefore we either omit the reading theſe Prayers commanded by the Church, or ſhrink them into a leſſer compaſs, we deſerve no better Appellation than that of Theeves. As then, we are earneſt for all our Tithes, ſo let us be careful that God may have all his Prayers; for he that will cut God ſhort of them, will not fear to cut him ſhort of any thing elſe whatever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There are many other Theeves which very much abuſe the Houſe of Prayer; but I ſhall conclude all in naming the Church-wardens, and other Officers, who are the Guardians of the Church; you are perſons in whom the Church repoſe her Confidence, that you will deal Faithfully with her in preſenting all Abuſes, but how you diſcharge your Truſt paſſeth my underſtanding; for none are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant many things are Preſentable, but nothing Preſented, ſo that from hence eſpecially, the Church is made a Den of Theeves; For would men dare to ſeperate from our Solemn Aſſemblies, if you were not ſo remiſs in your reſpective Duties? Will it not be a moſt piercing Wound to your Conſciences at the General Audit of God, that by your omitting to execute the Laws of the Church our Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as <hi>Medea</hi> did her Children) is rent into ſeveral Limbs, Bitts, and Pieces? What can be more terrible to you, then to conſider, that through the neglect of You, the Houſe of Prayer is made a Den of Theeves.</p>
               <p>Let me then beſeech all who are intruſted with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of the Church, to think they hear God ſpeaking
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:191991:25"/>unto them, as he did unto <hi>Joſhua, Wherefore lye you on your Faces, up and be doing, take away the accurſed Errors from amongſt you?</hi> Let the Laws be put in a ſevere Execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the Church, for obſtinacy muſt be Forced, not Courted by Peſwaſions, it is an Happy Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that pull men out of the Fire: They are Bleſſed Bonds, which tye men to Chriſt, Comfortable Fetters, which keep our Feet in the wayes of Peace; let them ſtile it Perſecution, Perſecution, God, I am ſure, will take it well at your hands, for 'tis his own method, to afflict the Body, that he may ſave the Soul, which if we do, we ſhall ſee God will ariſe, and his Enemies be ſcattered, then will the Glory of God be Exalted, Religion Flouriſh, and the Houſe of Prayer no longer a Den, but an Houſe at Unity in it ſelf; which that it may, God Enlighten the Hearts of all in Authority Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, that they may not be negligent in their Duties, but Strong and of good Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to Fight againſt them, who Fight againſt God, that there may be an advancement of Religion, a compoſure of all Chriſtian Animoſities, that Peace and Righteouſneſs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Piety, may be Eſtabliſhed among us for all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and let all who ſeek the Proſperity of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſay, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <p>Now then is the accepted time, This is the day wherein we muſt proclaim open Wars-againſt that Inveterate Enemy of Mankind. For that Warriour of Hell watches for Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to lullaby us a ſleep on the downy Beds of Sloath and Security, thereby to gain thoſe great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a ſurpriſe; becauſe he knows, if we don't cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend upon the Ordinances of God, and make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Progreſs in Holineſs, we do certainly yield our ſelves Servants to Sin, and are enſnared by theſe Nets he hath pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately laid to entrap men. For when God perceives I make no good uſe of thoſe Talents of Grace committed to my Truſt; not to my Truſt as to keep them enwrapped in a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, but to improve to a further growing in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; which, if I don't, he then will moſt juſtly withdraw theſe his Graces, which I have ſo fooliſhly miſ-imployed; and harden my heart, as well to puniſh me for my Wickedneſs, as alſo for my Folly; that then when I might have made uſe of his ſupporting Grace to aſſiſt me, I did willfully ſlight and neglect theſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:191991:27"/>of growing from Grace to Grace; <hi>For to day if you will hear his Voice harden not your Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Pſalm the Sweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> inſinuates an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Exhortation to Laud and Magnifie the Providence of God, in his Wiſe conduct of the World; together with that Infinite Wiſdom in contriving and managing the Illuſtrious Fabrick and oeconomy of the Church both Triumphant and Militant; and then he deſcends in <hi>v.</hi> 8. to exhort and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us not to Irritate and provoke him to Anger, by our Impenitent Courſe, and perſiſting in Wickedneſs; but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace every opportunity of Obedience to his Voice, and of a perfect reſignation to his Service and Pleaſure; leaſt by a contempt and hardning our Hearts, we tire and weary out the Patience of Heaven, till it puniſh us (as did thoſe of <hi>Meſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah</hi>) by a Sclemn Proteſtation and Oath, <hi>We ſhall not enter into the Land of Roſt, or Heavenly</hi> Canaan.</p>
            <p>The words are naturally ſo pregnant, I need not urge any thing there-from, but what preſents of its own accord: I ſhall not then enlarge my Meditations further, then to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you with this ſhort Propoſition.</p>
            <p>That we muſt not in the leaſt defer our Repentance, but inſtantly comply with Obedience to that Voice which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of us, <hi>For to day if you will hear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeriouſly conſidering the hard Province of a man to relinquiſh habituated Vices, adviſes all in his Book of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes, To remember their Creator in the days of their youth:</hi> For evident it is, nothing more difficult for a man, when he hath once ſet his Teeth on edge with the unwholſome Viands of Sin, than to reliſh the Savoury Meats of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>For Sin and Pleaſure leave ſuch a Tang and Hogoe in the mouths of Carnal men, it renders ſo pleaſant a guſt to the Infirmities of Humane Nature, that a Camel may as eaſily ruſh through the Eye of a Needle, as ſuch a perſon be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:191991:28"/>for the Kingdom of Glory; to which ſenſe are thoſe excellent words of the Prophet, <hi>Can the</hi> Aethiopian <hi>change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots,</hi> Then may you alſo do good, who are accuſtomed to do evil?</p>
            <p>He therefore that defers his Repentance in the Summer of his Age, and will not acknowledge his Sins whilſt he hath Strength, and Vigour, <hi>To reſiſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil,</hi> but involv'd them in the excuſes and denyal, and clouds of Hypocriſy. He will not find it a ſlender task, when all Diſeaſes and the Evils of Age, ſhall muſter up their forces in his Crazy-bones, when all his waſting pleaſures ſhall preſent their <hi>Items</hi> to his Bed rid view to find the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Repentance then.</p>
            <p>Many Doctors pertaining to the <hi>Roman Conclave,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the queſtion, <hi>At what time preciſely a Sinner is obliged to Repent,</hi> affirm, <hi>At what time ſoever;</hi> (for ſay they) <hi>the Precept of Repentance is of the ſame nature with that of Baptiſm and Prayer; Nor this day, nor to morrow, is it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to be Baptized, but ſometime or other; and if I Pray an hour or half hence, the duty of Prayer is perform'd as fully, as if I fell upon my Knees at the very inſtant of the Proclamation.</hi> But with ſubmiſſion to better Judgements, I dare boldly affirm, this aſſertion can neither be confirm'd by Holy Writ, or any Author, who Preach nothing but the Sineere Word of God. 'Tis true, I dare not conceal it, <hi>God deſires not the Death of a Sinner, but abundantly rather, that he turn and Live:</hi> Yet if one, who hath had the grand Bleſſing of Heaven to be born in the Pale of his Church, who hath the Sun ſhine of the Goſpel always beaming on him (whoſe Life engendring Rays are ſufficient to warm and ſoften a ſtony Heart; yes, <hi>And out of ſuch ſtones to raiſe up Children unto</hi> Abraham) if he will conſume his Youth and Beauty in the Service of ſin, wearing out the gloſs of his Life in open Hoſtility againſt God, and Rallying his Forces
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:191991:28"/>to Bandy againſt the Almighty, neither will he accept of his Services, when he is worn out with years, and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to preſent him but the thin Furrows and Wrinkles of Old Age.</p>
            <p>I appeal to your ſelves, how juſt and reaſonable it is for an Earthly Potentate, who promiſe me, if I will ſubmit to his Commands, and render an entire Obedience to all his Precepts for the ſpace of one year; at his expiration, he will load me with Honours, and burthen me with Riches; how juſt is it for him to refuſe me thoſe Honours, and deny me thoſe Riches, if I walk contrary to his ways, and will not be obedient to the Dictates of his Laws? May not then the Creator of Mankind, in like manner, withdraw the Graces we have ſo fooliſhly imbezelled and miſimploy'd.</p>
            <p>For is it reaſonable for me, profeſſing Chriſtianity to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel out the little moment of this Life, in Senſual Pleaſures and Delights, never taking a turn in the Melancholly Shades of a Penitent Soul, to imagine God will reward my Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Sorrow, as a Godly Sorrow, when I have Prodigally ſpent all my Sprightly Strength, in ranging the by-ways of Sin, and compleating the Kingdom of Satan; becauſe he who expects a conſummation of future Bliſs, muſt have his whole Life, and all his Actions free from every imputation and appearance of Evil.</p>
            <p>The great Shepherd of our Souls loves not a Spotted or Ring ſtreaked Flock; but our whole Lives muſt be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequered, and intire Holineſs.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as we have taken our Military Oath, and are Enroll'd under Chriſts Banner, we muſt begin our Warfare againſt the World, Fleſh and the Devil; not having the moſt little and inconſiderable paſſage of our Life ſtain'd, or ſullyed by the diſhonours of a dirty and unworthy Action; I mean not, that all the circumſtances of our Life, or whole retinue of our Actions can be as uncorrupted as the Rays of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:191991:29"/>the <hi>Sun,</hi> or as pure as the pure Sparklings of the <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> and Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> no, but yet we may in ſome meaſure reſemble the <hi>Moon,</hi> in which <hi>Phyloſophers</hi> acquaint us, there are certain Macule, or Spots, but no Deformities.</p>
            <p>Whilſt we are in this ſtate of Imperfection, we can't be ſo Clarified, as to be free from all Indiſcretions, Errors and Miſtakes: Fleſh and Blood are dayly attended by a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous train of Senſual Objects, which cauſes us to dwell in the neighbourhood of Ungodlineſs; but then ſo ſoon as I am ſenſible of this Defilement, or that Weakneſs, I muſt waſh it away in the Tears of Repentance: But if I perſevere in my Wickedneſs, and never inquire of my Conſcience what I have done, I willfully incurre my own Damnation, becauſe I am poſitively and directly bound for to repent ſo ſoon as I know I have offended, <hi>For to day if you will hear his Voice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, if we would be Happy hereafter, we muſt not in the leaſt defer our Repentance, but that is further urged by theſe following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The firſt Reaſon is drawn from the end and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, in commiſſioning the Diſpenſors of his <hi>Word, To lift up their Voices like Trumpets, to declare to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>their Sins, and to</hi> Judah <hi>their Tranſgreſſions:</hi> For wherefore is all this, if not to Alarum us into a preſent actual Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? For does God authorize thoſe who attend at his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to Thunder againſt our Sins, and incite us to Repent, and does he not intend we ſhould repent on that day he calls for it? Dare the Prophets and Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, bid us repent next year? Have they any Commiſſion will warrant them to ſay, It is very well and expedient to repent to day, but you incur no danger to defer it to a longer time, or more convenient ſeaſon, till you are well ſtricken in years, and your Heads Crowned with a Silver Crown of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:191991:29"/>Hoary Hairs? If it be thus, to what end do we Preach? If this be the drift of Pulpit Diſcourſes, wherefore are they made? Does not God require our exact Obedience? Does not he expect my Morning and Evening Sacrifices of Prayer and Thankſgiving? And can I offer this unto him, unleſs I ſeriouſly Repent? No certainly; ſo long then as I remain Impenitent, I deny my ſelf the Honourable Title of being the Servant of God, <hi>To day therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But then ſecondly, does not God every day dart ſome Beams of his Grace upon me? Do not he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly knock at the door of my heart, ſo long as the day of Salvation begins not to decline? Does not he ſend his Spirit to Invite, his Arguments to perſwade, and his Mercies to Enamour me of the Beauty of Holineſs? And are theſe things to be Play'd withall, or ſet light by? Is it not a Sin, once to reſiſt the Holy Spirit, and don't I reſiſt it, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have ſinned, and know it does incenſe my God, yet I continue ſo preſumptuous as not to repent at the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty in my Conſcience? Now is not he who reſiſts the Grace of God, ten, twenty, or thirty years, a much more Notorious Offender, than he who oppoſed it twenty dayes, and ſo on to twenty hours, and twenty minuits? The longer God hath patiently waited for our Repentance, much more infinitely diſoblig'd is he, if we don't Repent: How can I ſenſeleſly imagine his Anger would increaſe, if our ſins were not multiplied? Beſides, muſt not I repent of my reſiſting Gods Grace, of my refuſing to Hear, of my none-Attendance and neglect of the means of Salvation? Muſt not I give diligence to make my Calling and Election ſure? Muſt not I ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate? And why all theſe Exhortations and Incitements to Holineſs, if there be no Duty to be performed? To what intent ſerve all the Terrours and Aſrightments of Hell, if not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:191991:30"/>men to avoid all the diſmall Horrors and Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof? Wherefore are all the Promiſes of Eternal Life, and Crowns of Glory, if not to encourage, as well as to reward Obedience? And what can be reckoned a Contempt of Heaven, if this be not, that when God by his Preventing, his Exciting, his Encouraging, and his Aſſiſting Graces to invite us to Repentance. We, notwithſtanding all, will not Mourn for our Sins, nor be Sorrowful for our Offences.</p>
            <p>This is that wherewith God upbraided the Obſtinacy of his People, <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed; I have ſtretched out my Hand, and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at naught all my Councils, and would have none of my Reproof; I will therefore laugh at your Calamity, and mock when your Fear cometh,</hi> Prov. 1.25, 26, 27. Tell me now, is not every Calling of great moment and concern, and conſequently is not every ſlighting of it Criminal and dangerous, and does not God Call upon us daily? Let us put theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then we may derive this Natural conſequence, that he who Sins and does not ſpeedily Repent, at leaſt Sin twice; and every day we defer it, is a more compleated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to urge the Lord of Hoſts, to enter into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moury of his Wrath, and utterly conſume us, to which ſenſe are thoſe excellent words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of his Goodneſs, and Forbearance, and long Suffering, not knowing that the Goodneſs of God lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee to Repentance,</hi> Rom. 2.3. That is,</p>
            <p>Every Action of Gods Loving Kindneſs, and forbearing to puniſh our Sinful Courſes, is an Argument for, and a Motive to Repentance; and our not ſtretching forth our Hand to lay hold on this Tree of Life, our refuſing to waſh in this River <hi>Jordan,</hi> our not being Reformed or made better by it, is ſtiled by the Apoſtle, <hi>A deſpiſing his Goodneſs,</hi> and every non-repented day, a Treaſuring up Wrath, againſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:191991:30"/>the day of Wrath: For, if we wilſully perſiſt in our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate reſiſting all theſe methods of Divine Mercy, it will certainly add greater weight to our ruine, when God ſhall puniſh or reward according to our Actions; <hi>To day therefore if you will hear his,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet Oh! the ſtupidity of Mankind! So dull and careleſs, are we to apprehend our future good and advantage, that we wax Old in Sin, and Gray in Iniquity; we judge the hours of our Life glide and vaniſh away too nimbly for the acting of our Sin, but comes too faſt for our Repentance. In my private Meditations and cloſe Retirements into my own Breaſt, I have Chriſtianly commiſerated; yea, my heart hath even bled, at a man Rightly Principled in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, able to Adminiſter Sage Councel to others, Diſcreet enough to conduct the various Intrigues of a Family, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reſolved concerning the Intereſts of this Life; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring Gods-Houſe every <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Feſtival,</hi> giving great Attention to the Diſpenſors of Gods word, the Sermons of the Goſpel, and the ſoft murmurings of the Holy Spirit: Men who underſtand the woful Eſtate of them, who die without Abſolution and Remiſſion of their Sins, who are not inſenſible, that the Wrath of God, like the Puniſhment of <hi>Cain,</hi> is greater than we can bear, yet inevitably incident on all them who prevent it not by opportune Repentance.</p>
            <p>Is it not a lamentable and doleful ſight, to obſerve men, ſo well qualified for Virtue, and a Pious Life, dayly Sinning againſt God, entring into all Temptations, and as it were,
<hi>Ornare Diabolum,</hi> Become Learned Spoils to the Enemy of our Salvation, yet never think on Repentance, but reſolves to venter for it till the laſt Breath, and for its acceptance too at ſo untimely a Seaſon.</p>
            <p>For, it is firſt a great hazard whether God will then aſſiſt me with ſo much Grace as to Repent; which if he do, I then
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:191991:31"/>ſecondly, run the venture of an After game, whether that Repentance will be acceptable by him; becauſe without Controverſy it cannot be perfected. For if Holy Writ, by a true Repentance, underſtand and mean an Amendment and Reformation of Life, as certainly it does: Then tell me, what difference is there, not to Repent at all, or not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it, till the laſt Thread of Life be a Spinning: For, how can I Amend, Reform, or lead a new courſe of Life; when alas! poor Creature that I am! I am no longer to be! <hi>To day therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Are not all the Leaves of the Book of Life Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortatory Perſwaſions to a ſpeedy Repentance? For where God commandeth me to Pray, there he urgeth to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; becauſe otherwiſe, my Prayer would be defective, and render no ſweet ſmelling Savour in the Noſtrils of God.</p>
            <p>Nay without Repentance, I pronounce it impoſſible to Pray to God with that Ardour and Zeal we are obliged: For, to Pray aright, is to caſt away all Affections to Sin, the leaſt Glances to Temptations, to be Sorry we have Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with a full Reſolution never to be Guilty of the like Tranſgreſſion, or the ſame Madneſs; and thereupon <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> declar'd, <hi>The Prayer of the Wicked is an abomination to the Lord:</hi> Yea, conſult Truth it ſelf, and you may hear it declaring, <hi>I hate your Burnt Offerings, my Soul loathes your Solemn Aſſemblies; bring me no more vain Oblations:</hi> They are adjudged vain and loathſome, becauſe not perfumed with the ſweet Incenſe of Repentance. Thus you may hear the man in the Goſpel declaring, <hi>God heareth not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> John 9.31. (that is) Thoſe who have ſinned, and have not yet repented; being unhappy in their haſty Sin, much more miſerable in their ſlow Repentance.</p>
            <p>An Impenitent perſon Soiles and Diſcolours every other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well approved Action, he Envenomes and Poiſons
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:191991:31"/>even the very Mercy of God: For, if ſuch a man Pray, what is it eſteemed more, than Howling? If he Mourn, what is it more, than hanging down the Head like a Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſh? If he Sacrifice, what is it, but the cutting off a Dogs neck? If he rejoyce, what is ſuch mirth, <hi>But a Blaze and Crackling of Thorns under the Pot?</hi> For God regards and gives ear to none but the Penitent, on which account you may obſerve, Chriſt commanding us to Pray, and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us what we ſhould Pray for, enjoyns us every day, <hi>To Pray for the remiſſion of our Sins;</hi> Mat. 6.10, 11. We can't requeſt our dayly Bread, unleſs we beg a dayly forgiveneſs of our Sins. So likewiſe Holy <hi>David</hi> in the Text, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> from the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, To day if you will hear,</hi> &amp;c. Not only ſtrictly commanding us, not to put off our Repentance one day, but alſo affirming, every ſuch delay is an act of Obduration, and ſo a new ſin is added to the old. So oft then as I meditate on thoſe Melodious Words, and Charming Eloquence, of the Son of <hi>Syrach, I ſeem'd to hear all the bright morning Stars and Sons of Glory, calling to us below, to make no tarrying to turn unto the Lord, and to put not off from day to day, for ſudain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy ſecurity thou ſhalt be deſtroyed, and periſh in the day of Vengeance,</hi> Eccleſiaſticus 5.7.</p>
            <p>For every day of our Life, may probably be adjudged the day of our Burial; for what is it more than the Life of Roſes, which in the Evening make a Tomb, of that Scarlet which was its morning Ornament and Glory? What reaſon therefore can be more prevalent than this, to provide the beſt Arguments we can for our Juſtification before Death; becauſe God frequently ſmites Sinners in their Confidences, he ſtrikes them in their Securities, in their Delays, they may meet with a Surpriſe; in their Procraſtinations, they may be fruſtrated of their Hopes, and Death may rob
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:191991:32"/>them of the Benefits and Advantages of to morrow. For what is bold man, (as ſome confidently ſpeak) to reſolve not to Repent till <hi>Chriſtmaſs, Eaſter, Whitſontide,</hi> next Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or ſuch prefix'd Feſtival and Seaſons: Alas! poor Duſt and Aſhes that we are! How probable is it whilſt we revolve ſuch Thoughts in our mind, an Impoſthume, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our Head or Breaſt, may make us big with Death?</p>
            <p>How probable is it, ſome popular Diſeaſe raging in our Streets, may ſlay him in three days time? May not to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows Dinner breed a Surfeit, or this nights Intemperance a Feaver, How oft do we ſee Death riding Triumphant in our Dwellings, and Crowned with the Spoils of many numbers of Men? Alas! it is impoſſible to enumerate all the poſſibilities of dying Suddainly, or the Probabilities how ſoon our Lives may be ravel'd out to its utmoſt Thread: For though we flatter our ſelves in the Plentiful-leſt hopes of a Gaudy Fortune, Death may meet ev'ry one of us, with a <hi>Thou Fool, this night ſhall thy Soul be taken from thee.</hi> Let any one therefore, who hath any thing beſides the Shape and Lineament of a Man, but really acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he is Mortal; let him but confeſs himſelf to be a man, and ſubject to the Accidents of Mortality; and that very Confeſſion, muſt be a confutation of them who defer their Repentance. For, I appeal to your ſelves, Is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for me, who confeſs my ſelf a Sinner, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of a Supreme Exiſtence, and believe, that he knows I am a Sinner, and will Infallibly puniſh me for my Sins, if not waſhed away with the Tears of Repentance; can I be thought Rational, and in my Wits, if I defer it, unleſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the confidence of a long Life? And grant my Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould the promiſing my ſelf many days promote a Life and ſtate of Impenitency? Is it ſo intolerable to live Virtuouſly? Is the Yoak of Chriſt ſo uneaſie? Are the Commandments of God ſo Grievous? Will to live Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:191991:32"/>Soberly and Godly in this preſent World, quite ſtrip us of our pleaſant days, and make us waſt our Hours in a Moroſs Auſterity or Sullen Gravity? Or are the hopes of Life intended for no other purpoſe than to delay our Sin, and defer our Repentance; God forbid, for ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes can't be guilty of a worſe Concluſion. However, he that ſeriouſly meditates on thoſe many numbers of men; who, like little Bloſſoms, are Cropt by the Scythe of Death in the Tenderneſs of their Age, will have but ſmall reaſon to conſent to theſe evil purpoſes from ſuch weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Principles.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell the preciſe Minuit of my Death, or take an exact meaſure of this Span of Life; and then, to defer my Repentance, is a Sham put upon my own Soul, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all the Divine Revelations of Heaven and Hell.</p>

And Oh! the mighty Influence! it would have upon our Lives, if the conſideration might ſink into our Hearts of thoſe many numbers of Perſons, as Good, as Wiſe, as Daring and Confident: Yes, and by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Health, as likely to Live as we; yet have been ſnatched away, by a Death ſo ſuddain, that their very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their Repentance but one day, nay but one hour, may have proved their Eternal ruine.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:191991:33"/>
            <p>Had they but Repented the day before, it wou'd have look'd like a deſign of Grace, and an act of Election, and have rendred their condition Hopeful.</p>
            <p>If we ſeriouſly weigh ſuch conſiderations in our breaſt, we ſhall conclude it neceſſary, in the higheſt degree, that we make neither loitering, nor ſtay in our being reconciled unto God; becauſe one hours, nay minuits ſtay, may not only by a peradventure, but in a real and true event of things, prove to be one of theſe Sins, called the Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, I mean, final Impenitency.</p>
            <p>For, as I who die young, and in the prime of my ſtrength and vigour, am as really dead, as he who dies after an Age of 40, 50, or 60 years Travel; ſo is that Impenitency final, under which I am Arreſted by Death in the very birth, and infancy of my Crimes, as much as if I had laid Bed-rid in my Repentance, be ſnatch'd from hence to die Eternally in Hell.</p>
            <p>The Evil is not of ſo black a dye, the Judgement is not of ſo ſevere a ſtamp, but equally as Fatal, equally as irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as the Decrees and Sentences of Damnation on thoſe who are held in Chains until the Judgement of the great day.</p>
            <p>Moreover, may we not obſerve the ſtupid fooliſhneſs of man, to ſlight and neglect thoſe beſt opportunities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, whilſt the Marrow ſwells in our Bones, our Blood be hot, and boils within our Vains, when we are beſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of performing the ſeveral Duties of it, then to put it off till we grow Crazy and Infirm; for are Dimme Eyes, Deaf Ears, Pale Viſage, Decay'd Teeth, Withered Skin, Stinking Breath, Furred Pipes, Trembling Knees, Fumbling Hands, Falling Feet, a Stammering Tongue, and a Ratling Throat; fit Qualifications and ſuitable Embeliſhments for one rendring an Account to the Impartial Judge of Heaven and Earth? <hi>To day therefore if you will hear his Voice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:191991:33"/>
            <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, When a man warps from the direct path of Virtue, it is obvious and common to rebuke him; for every Sober, and Honeſt perſon is covetous and deſirous, that his unhappy Friend or Acquaintance ſhou'd forſake his purſuit in Wickedneſs, and leave off his courſe in Impiety: We therefore require him to be ſorry for his Sin, to deteſt and hate his Crime, reſolving for the future never to be guilty of the like Enormity.</p>
            <p>Now, I pray conſider, wherefore is all this, if not upon the ſame account that God does it; becauſe to perſiſt in it, can't poſſibly be good, but to relinquiſh it, very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; to dwell or tarry therein is dangerous, and a ſtate of Evil; and to chuſe to dwell there, what is it, but an Act of Love to that ſtate, and conſequently impoſſible to be free and void of offence? And not to Repent, when by good Admonitions I am forewarned of my danger, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to abide there; and when I conſider, and know that I have Sinned, and am not abſolved of mine Iniquities, then does Gods Spirit, and the Principles of our Religion mind me of my danger, and threaten my Ruine, if I perverſely venture my ſelf on ſuch dangerous Precipices; ſo that the Concluſion is undenyable, no man can ſo much as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he hath ſinned (and remain Impenitent) without an Addition, or at leaſt a Repetition of the ſame Sin.</p>
            <p>But then is not our Natural and In-bred diſpoſition to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite others, a potent Argument, that the ſame obligation binding them, commands it of every one of us in our own particular?</p>
            <p>Seeing we all pretend to flatter our ſelves, as capable of giving good Council, will it not ſtain our Wiſdom, if our ſelves refuſe to follow the Dictates of our own Sage Advices? Now then is the accepted time, this is the day of Salvation.</p>
            <p>Thus a famous Champion of Chriſtianity piouſly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Reſolutions, and at laſt fix'd on ſuch a preſent actual
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:191991:34"/>Obedience; for nothing could end his queſtions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the rufflings of his Conſcience, but to interpret the Precept of Repentance in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the very preſent juncture, and at no time elſe.</p>
            <p>Differens dicebam modo, ecce mode, ſine Paululum, ſed modo &amp; môdo non habuerat modum.</p>
            <p>I would Anon, and againſt the next Week, againſt the next Communion, or againſt the Feſtival, but there was no end of this; <hi>Subfico igitur me ſtravi flens, Quamdiu, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu, Cras, &amp; Cras, quare non modo, quare non hâc horâ finis Turpitudinis mei?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Wept, and ſaid, how long ſhall I ſay to morrow? How long ſhall I ſay till the next Communion? Why not now? Why ſhould I not by an immediate Repentance put a cloſe and period to my Crime? If not till to morrow, or the next Feſtival, there is as great an Argument for every day of our Life in which we can ſay to morrow.</p>
            <p>There is enough that can determine us to day, but there is nothing that can determine us to morrow! If it be not neceſſary now, it will not be convenient then, or ever like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be expedient, ſo long as there be a Morrow-morning to our Life.</p>
            <p>He therefore, who deſires the welcom of a Faithful and diligent Servant, muſt be early at his <hi>Work,</hi> and begin forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to do the Will of his Father which is in Heaven. To which purpoſe, I have ſomewhere read one adviſing us to imitate the Example of the Theef upon the <hi>Croſs. To do as he did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, we are eaſily decoyed by the Subtilty of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to do as he did; I mean defer our Repentance unto the laſt gaſp of breath, having the great Encouragements of his happy ſucceſs. Alas! no we don't follow his ſteps! Thrice Happy men were we! If we did reſemble Him in his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For, I will dare to aver, he did not defer his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:191991:34"/>until the laſt, for ſo ſoon as early Beams of the <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteouſneſs peeped through the Curtains of his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and ſhin'd in his Heart, he embraced his Saviour with the Arms of Faith, believed on him, and was really Converted; ſo ſoon as he heard of a Chriſt, he confeſs'd him a Saviour, and without the leaſt heſitation, or delay, Repented him of his former miſ-ſpent Actions. And if we Tranſcribe his Copy, we muſt Repent ſo ſoon as we hear Chriſt Preached unto us, and then our Repentance is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprovable, but otherwiſe our Damnation is unavoidable.</p>
            <p>Why art thou ſo dull and drowſy then, O ſinful Creature? What phrenſey poſſeſſeth thee, thus to defer thy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Can this delay conſiſt with any Chriſtian Grace? With Faith, Hope and Charity? With Prudence or Piety? With the Love of God, or of our own Souls? Thus to withſtand the ſhock of the Thunder, to oppoſe the mouth of the Canon, and dare the Omnipotents Anger? All which are the dreadful effects of an Impenitent Heart, for God hateth him, who grows fat in his Sin, and waxes Luſty in his Tranſgreſſions; And is it ſo idle, ſo indifferent a concern, to be deteſted by the Fountain of Love and Goodneſs?</p>
            <p>When the little Son of <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaw a Company of Theeves Pilfering his Fathers Houſe, and carrying away the Rich Veſſels of Gold, and <hi>Attick</hi> Talents, the Child Smil'd and Whip'd his Top; But when a Boy, who accompanied the Theeves, rob'd him of his little Inſtrument for Sport, he could then cry out, raiſing the Neighbourhood, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Theeves.</p>
            <p>Thus, and much more Childiſh is he, who Plays and Sports himſelf in the Careſſes of Sin, and in the <hi>Interim</hi> his Soul is ſtollen away by that <hi>Goliah</hi> of Hell, who gives us Toys and Pebbles, the more eaſily to Delude, and Couſen us of this our moſt precious Jewel. How would ſuch a man be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Fury, and Rage, at the loſs of his Goods? Is he not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:191991:35"/>too Jealous of his Fortunes to commend one hour to the Pidelity of Theeves? Would he venture his Body two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuits in the reach of an Enraged Lyon? Yet, how uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly! does he permit his Soul to be ſnatch'd away by that Roaring Lyon, who goes about ſeeking what Souls he may devour! He leaves it in pawn to that great Tyrant, Months and Years, in a danger ſo amazing, it would even Stagger and Diſtract, all the Reaſon of Mankind could it poſſibly be underſtood but half ſo great as in reality it is.</p>
            <p>'Tis reported, the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> wondred how a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Gentleman could have his Senſes ſo ſtrongly bound by the Silken Chains of Sleep, having contracted ſo great Debts, as he had not wherewith to ſatisfie his Creditors; having therefore expos'd his Houſe-hold-ſtuff to Sale, the Emperour would needs buy the Pillow yielding ſo Sweet Repoſe and Reſt.</p>
            <p>How then may we admire the Supine negligence of them, who uſually go to Bed, expecting a ſoft Slumber to ſteal upon their Eyes, when they are Infinitely Indebted to God by their Sins, yet ſeldom or never examine their Accounts, or prove Supplicants to the Throne of Grace, that God would Pardon their Sins, and do away their Offences.</p>
            <p>What is it then, O dull and and finful Soul, which makes thee thus confident in thy State? What Evaſion canſt thou make for thy Non-repentance? What excuſe for this Progreſs in Sin, and little regard of its Remiſſion? Doſt thou ſay,</p>
            <p>Thou confeſſeſt thy ſelf a Sinner of no ſmall degree, but God is Merciful and you hope for Salvation through that Mercy, and the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt? Theſe, though the common, yet are but weak Arguments for Chriſtians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; for though without Controverſy, God is a God of Mercy, and eaſily entreated; ſtill he is a God of Juſtice, expecting to be feared: As he is my Father, he will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, but as he is my Soveraign, he muſt be obeyed.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:191991:35"/>Chriſt, I acknowledge, hath abundantly ſatisfied for the Redemption of all deſcending from the loyns of <hi>Adam;</hi> But muſt we therefore neglect the means of Salvation, and the end of our Hopes, Eternal Life?</p>
            <p>Come, tell me I beſeech you, wherefore did Chriſt die and ſhed his Blood, was it only for your and my Pardon; did He bear the Croſs, that We might bear none? Or was it the deſign of his Death to get us a Diſpenſation from Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Living? Or rather, was not this his end and purpoſe, by keeping us from dying, to make us alive to God? By denying himſelf, to invite us to take up our Croſs, and follow him, and not to procure us a Liberty to execute our Will and Pleaſure?</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> confirms this Doctrine, <hi>For he died, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to Sin ſhould live unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. So that unleſs we live to Righteouſneſs, his Scourges will not ſave us from the Laſh: His Crucifixion will be inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant unto us, if we do not Crucifie our Carnal Appetites; nor will his Death ranſome us from dying, if our Sins ſtill live.</p>
            <p>For can we think ſo diſhonourable of Chriſt, as to make him a Cheriſher of ſuch Traytors? Does he take care for their Protection, and ſet up a Sanctuary to which they may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flee? Is the Altar of the <hi>Croſs</hi> an <hi>Aſylum,</hi> or Refuge, for thoſe who gather themſelves together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed. Are the unmanly Senſualities of the World ſo highly favoured by God, that he will ſend his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, <hi>à Latere,</hi> Son from his Boſom to die in defence, and behalf of them? How groſs a miſtake is this! when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Forgiveneſs of our Sins, was not ſo much intended by the Death of Chriſt, as the Purifying of our Hearts and Lives; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> (as well as the other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd place of St. <hi>Peter</hi>) tells us, <hi>That Chriſt gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from this preſent World,</hi> (that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:191991:36"/>is) By ſhewing his willingneſs to paſs by our Faults, he would even melt and win us to acknowledge our Treſpaſſes, to repent of them, and for the future to become more Dutiful and Obedient.</p>
            <p>Up then quickly, O <hi>Elijah,</hi> Eat and Drink, for thou haſt a great Journey to go: Let us up Sirs, and be doing, and not Prorogue ſo weighty a buſineſs any longer, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to Reform; when alas! frail Creatures! We muſt ceaſe to be! — 'Twill be too late to ſay, <hi>Father I have Sinned,</hi> when it will be only Seaſonable to cry, <hi>Corruption thou art my Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, they are not a few Death bed Sighs will waft us over to theſe <hi>Elyſium</hi> Fields: They are not a few Momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Groans and Mournful Lamentations will Capacitate us fit Candidates for the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Oh! the Horrour and Amazement! which will benum our Senſes, when Death ſhall make its ſuddain Addreſſes to us, and ſummon us from our Beds of Security to appear before God at the Tribunal of Juſtice!</p>
            <p>Will it not be too late to ſay then, <hi>Lord I Repent,</hi> when an Impartial and Severe Judge is ready to pronounce, <hi>A go ye Curſed into Everlaſting Fire?</hi> Oh! Conſider this all ye that forget God! Oh! Conſider this, all ye who forget your Souls are Immortal! And now, <hi>Before the Night cometh when no man can Work;</hi> Let us earneſtly and humbly beſeech him, whoſe Nature and Property is always to have Mercy, and to Forgive, to receive our Humble Petitions: And though we be tyed and bound with the Chain of our Sins, yet let the Pitifulneſs of thy great Mercy looſe us, O Lord, for the Honour of Jeſus Chriſt our Mediator and Advocate. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>SO great and fatal was the overthrow of the Sons of men in their Original Apoſtaſie from their God, that the whole Creation even Sigh and Groan under it.</p>
            <p>For, though it is true, God firſt raiſing the Structure of Mankind out of nothing built it moſt compleatly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, there were no Errata's to be found, nothing of Imperfection, but all Fair and Lovely.</p>
            <p>What an Accurate Harmony! what an Immaculate Beauty was found in him! A juſt and Regular Tendency, without the leaſt Swerving or Deviation; for he had no inclination or proneſs to Evil: For though his Body was not Beautified equally with thoſe, which are Glorified, yet it was Dutyful and Obedient, and never remiſs in paying its due Homage to the Soul.</p>
            <p>The very Senſitive Powers were neither Factious or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, but willingly ſubject to the Higher Powers, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual; there were no violent motions or perturbations, which ſince have bred ſuch Phantaciſms and Inſurrections
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:191991:37"/>in the Soul; In a word, no Paſſion which had any tendency to Sin: May we not then ſtand amaz'd, may we not then admire? How ſo Beautiful a Creature ſhould be ſoon wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? How that fragrant Breath God breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be ſo ſoon corrupted? Shall I cenſure the untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Will for this defect? Would not that be unjuſt, when it yielded ſo entire an obſervance to all the Dictates of his underſtanding? Or what? Shall I fault the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Would not this ſuppoſe him malitiouſly, and on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſin againſt God contrary to the ſenſe of his own Judgement? And ſhall I entertain a thought ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the firſt root, from whence I derive my Being? ſhall I make his Offence nothing inferiour to that of the Apoſtate Angels thrown into Miſery irrevocable? — Let us rather preſume, that this underſtanding was defective in its office by a negligent Non-attendance; for though the Eye was clear enough, yet it was not ſufficiently vigilant; though the Ballance was not deceitful, yet <hi>Adam</hi> forgot to weigh things therein, and ſo was deſpoiled, not only in all thoſe Supernatural Endowments, but even wounded in all thoſe Natural Capacities he had, to remain in an Innocent and Sinleſs ſtate. Yes, and thoſe ſower Grapes he Eat, have ſo edged his Childrens Teeth, that they can't perform what they would, but in an impulſive manner are driven and ſpurr'd on by propentions, <hi>To do what they hate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With how great Virtue ſoever a Soul is fortified, Humane Nature hath Weakneſſes it cannot diſavow; and how great reſiſtance ſoever it make, through Principles of Virtue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt irregular motions, yet if it be not ſupported by an eſpecial Endowment and Providence, it muſt at ſometimes yield and give moſt viſible marks of Frailty; for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have got ſuch an Empire over us, that we can't ſhake them off, ſo long as we remain in a ſtate of Nature, and not of Grace; and therefore the Author of our Text ſpeaking
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:191991:37"/>of the Imbecilities of men, he means as they are Naturally deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> and not as they are Enobled by the Favours of Heaven through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For, though it is true, ſo long, as I am a meer man, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, and in a ſtate of Carnality, I dwell in the Regions of Death, ſo that I cannot act according to Grace, but ſenſe. Yet when I am redeemed by the Blood of Chriſt, I am no longer in the Dominions of Sin; I am no longer a ſlave, but Chriſts freed man, he hath Manumiz'd me, and ſet me at Liberty, ſo that I cannot then Complain, <hi>What I hate, that do I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Proſecution of my Diſcourſe, I ſhall firſt ſhow you the true and genuine Cauſe of mans Imbecility; <hi>That he cannot do, but what he hates.</hi> Secondly, A poſſibility, yea abſolute neceſſity of his Conqueſt over theſe Enemies of his Salvation. Thirdly, I ſhall anſwer an Enquiry. And laſtly make Application.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We begin with the Cauſes of Humane Imbecilities, and though they are many, ſuch as bad Education, evil Habits, Cuſtoms and the like; yet I ſhall bend my Diſcourſe to the Primary one, Natural Corruption.</p>
            <p>For ſuch is the Imbecility of our Nature, ever ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> either to gratifie his Senſual Appetite, or (as I rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf) out of a complacent humour towards his young Miſtreſs in the Garden, taſted of the forbidden Fruit, that we are incapacitated to give Life and Birth ſo much as to one good Thought: Holy <hi>David</hi> was very ſenſible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when he cryes out, <hi>I was conceived in Sin,</hi> Pſal. 51.5.</p>
            <p>From the firſt inſtant of my Conception, Sin ſeized on me; and though that Lineal ſtain was cleared by Circumciſion under the Law, and now by Baptiſm under Diſpenſation of the Goſpel; yet there ſtill remains a Propenſity to Sin,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:191991:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>which grows up with me, gaining ſtrength through the whole courſe of my Adoleſcence.</p>
            <p>For many years of my Age ſlide away, before I arrive at that ripeneſs to diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil; in the Series of which time I follow without ſtop, or heſitation the Dictamens of Senſe; ſo that at the firſt unclaſping the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of my Underſtanding, at the firſt peeping forth of any Rays of Light to diſpel the Darkneſs had over-ſpread my Intellectuals I diſcover a Law Anathematizing all my former Practices, the which by many re-iterated and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Acts are ſo wrought into Habit, that to break them, I muſt (as it were) mould my ſelf into another Nature. This conſidered, together with the Dreggs and Relicks of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption Original Sin leaves behind, I wonder not our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle declare, <hi>What I hate, that do I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this Fumes, or ſcattered Seed of Original Sin hath a double Effect; one, an Inclination to that which is Evil, the other a backwardneſs to, or a declining from that which is good: And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>He found a Law in his Body contradicting that of his Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though without Controverſy Sin may be waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Sprinkling of Water, and the Holy Ghoſt: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to perfect a Cure, that I feel neither the Spice nor Itching thereof, is, in a manner impoſſible; at leaſt, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a long courſe of Remedies by a conſtant exerciſe and tryal in Virtuous Actions. For what is Sin, but</p>
            <p>An Inordinate and Habitual Concupiſcence in the Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part; ſo radicated, that it becomes, as it were, a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature? Whence <hi>Seneca</hi> did affirm, <hi>Virtues are rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or never acquir'd without a Maſter, but we quickly grow expert in Vice without the help of any Teacher.</hi> All which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the pernicious conſequences of our firſt Parents Offence.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:191991:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Nay further, let us look into our Breaſts, and tell me I Pray, are not you, and I, ſenſible, that many Actions we do are highly Offenſive to the God whom we Worſhip, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to our own Souls; yet ſtill we are hurried on by that violent vehemency of Natural Inclinations we cannot but Act them.</p>
            <p>Thus the Poet brings in <hi>Medea</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>I underſtand,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>that the (utting, or Tearing my little Babes into bitts and pieces, is a moſt horrid Crime, and I ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, but my Paſſion overcomes my Reaſon.</hi> Thus he in the Tragedy did confeſs, <hi>I am not ignorant of thoſe things thou Admoniſheſt me againſt, I am ſatisfied I ought not to be guilty of them, but my Nature forceth me contrary to my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And what was this ſmart Doom, a proneſs to do Evil, but a juſt retaliation for our Diſobedience! For ſince the Soul had been Diſobedient to her Creator, what higher Juſtice could there be, than that the Body in requital ſhould riſe up in Rebellion againſt the Soul, and puniſh her by the ſame Engines ſhe had made uſe of in her prevarication.</p>
            <p>Fleſh and Blood may cenſure it hard and ſevere, but it is not moſt juſt, that God ſhould puniſh Millions of men, for the Tranſgreſſion of one?</p>
            <p>For ſeeing (if <hi>Adam</hi> had been Obedient) that tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Happineſs promiſed to him, had been Entailed on you, and me, and all his Poſterity; why ſhould not I, and you, and all that deſcend from that Fountain, ſhare (by his Fall) in the Pain due to his Tranſgreſſion? It may indeed fill us full of doubts and perplexities to conſider man in this totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring condition, that he cannot do the good he deſires, or flee from the Evil he hates and abominates; becauſe we know not by what ſtrange bewitching means our Will (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd by ſin) is hamper'd in a kind of neceſſity; yes, and in ſuch a manner, as neither the neceſſity, (becauſe volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary) can plead excuſe for our conſent; nor can the Will
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:191991:39"/>being allured, ſcarce break through the neceſſity, becauſe this neceſſity is in a ſort voluntary. How can I reſemble it better, than to a kind of Amorous Violence working by Flattery, and Flattery by Force; Whence the Will, having once conſented to Sin, can hardly diſ-engage her ſelf, nor yet find Arguments enough to excuſe what ſhe hath done. No marvail then that <hi>Job</hi> complains, <hi>Lord I ſuffer Violence, it is only you who impoſe, the neceſſity can Anſwer for me.</hi> And a little after he cryes, <hi>O thou Ruler of men, why haſt thou ſet me againſt thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have read <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> ſpeaking of Original Sin, gives it a term of <hi>Infinity, That being once ſet on a flame, can never be extinguiſh'd; it is an Immortal Evil, by no Death or Deſolation to be deſtroyed.</hi>

               <p>Now what idle? what Impertinent Admonitions are they, if we cannot ſuppreſs thoſe Traytors which labour to undoe us? Why do we ſolemnly Aſſemble our ſelves together? Why are we attentive to the Preachings of the Goſpel? Why do we, who are ſtiled the Watchmen of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſpend our Breath, and our Lungs? Is it only to tickle our Ears and exhort us to Impoſſibilities?

               <p>He that ſins, and flatters himſelf to ſin contrary to his Will, and againſt his Inclination; may juſtly conclude his Heart to be Treacherous and Falſe; for is it poſſible for me to Pray for a Deliverance, and not have the event of my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, unleſs I ask amiſs? Shall a man Labour, and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours not Crowned with a Proſperous Succeſs, unleſs he La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Deceitfully? It is therefore groſs abſurdity, for a man to Hugg and Cokes himſelf with the fond conceit, his Heart is good, his Intentions Honeſt, and though he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall, 'tis a ſlip of Nature, Weakneſs, and Infirmity, yea he could no ways help it; becauſe, if I do not perform what I deſire, and ought to do, I confeſs my ſelf to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dictates of my own Conſcience: And, will that extenuate, or rather is it not an Aggravation of my Crime, that the checks of my Conſcience could not deter me from the Commiſſion of it?</p>
               <p>What a poor Plea! what a ſad Apology! will it be, at the Great and Dreadful Tribunal of Heaven, for me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I know the Acting, or Living thus, and thus, ſo, and ſo, was notoriouſly bad, offending my God, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing my Soul, but the pleaſantneſs of the Company, the Humouring a Friend, the greatneſs of the Temptation could not be withſtood, for were it not for Temptations, how could we maintain our Warfare againſt the three Cardinal Enemies of mans Salvation, <hi>Sin, the World, and the Devil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are our Enemies, we are the Souldiers muſt fight the Battles of the Lord; our meaning cannot be good, if we do not valiantly withſtand all oppoſitions. For it is not enough that I ſpeak like an Angel, Pray with great zeal and vehemency of Spirit; if (my Devotions Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) I prove as Paſſionate as ever, as Waſpiſh as an amazed or diſturbed Fly, if I be Refractory to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Countrey; if I Cenſure the Actions of my Prince, or ridicule the Demeanours of them placed in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

All that Purity and Saintſhip, all that Spiritual Life I pride my ſelf in, is nothing more, than Spiritual Fancy and Illuſion, whilſt I am under the Power of my unruly Deſires, ſo that I contentedly follow and am led by them!</p>
               <p>I pray tell me, do not we cenſure it difficult, and uneaſie to be guilty of the madneſs of thoſe who talk ſplendidly of Religion, yet practice nothing leſs.</p>
               <p>The common Swearer cannot forbear his habituated and accuſtomed ſin, yet if he Diſcourſes of the Authority of the Bible, and Principles of Religion, one would think him a Saint; and thoſe perſons themſelves, who ſpeak ſo bravely, imagine they cannot Act, ſo much as they Diſcourſe; yet both of them are under the Power of their reſpective Sins, and are equally deceived, for neither are the Servants of God; yet there is no neceſſity to do this, becauſe we are obliged, yes, and (God hath commanded me to tell you alſo) it is in our Power to do better if we pleaſe: Thus you may hear the Apoſtle.</p>

                  <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fullfil the Luſts of the Fleſh, for the Spirit luſteth againſt the Fleſh, and Fleſh againſt the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.16, and 17. Where he means,</p>
               <p>That as there is a State of Carnality (before Baptiſm or Regeneration) in the which, a man cannot but be in Awe and Subjection to the Fleſh; ſo there is a ſtate of Spirituality (after Regeneration) when Sin is dead, and Righteouſneſs is alive, and in this ſtate the Fleſh can no more get the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, then the Spirit could be Victor in the other.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:191991:41"/>
               <p>I dare not deny it, ſuch is the ſad condition of ſome men, that they cannot but Sin, becauſe the Apoſtle hath told me, <hi>The Carnal mind is not ſubject to God, nor can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7.</p>
               <p>There are others, in like manner, who cannot endure the leaſt tendency to Sin; to a mild and peaceable diſpoſition, how diſagreeable is the Nature of a Contentious, wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling perſon, to a Sober and Temperate perſon, how tedious is the Company of Hectoring Debauchees, To a Chaſt and Modeſt perſon? how ſhameful are Proſtitutions and Beaſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Luſt? Conſider this, and tell me, is it impoſſible for a perſon whoſe mind is built upon Righteouſneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt thoſe ſnares and direct Treaſons againſt the Soul? Thus you may hear the boſom-Diſciple breathing it out, <hi>He that is born of God doth not commit ſin, nor can he, becauſe he is born of God.</hi>

               <p>Can a corrupt Tree have good, or a good Evil Fruit flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing thereon?

               <p>For where is the Perſon, ſhow me a man but of common Prudence, and Ordinary Reputation in the World, would be tempted upon the Padd: What price would purchaſe him to Murther his Brother, or the Deareſt of his Friends?</p>
               <p>May not our dayly converſe with the World acquaint us, that men, who are none of the great Sages, and eminent Hero's for Parts and Underſtanding, yet have Power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Conquer the greateſt Sins? And what? Shall I be Crowned with the <hi>Olive Branches</hi> and <hi>Palms,</hi> ſhall I erect Trophies for my Victory over <hi>Goliah?</hi> Can I conquer the Sons of the Gyant, and ſtouteſt of the Sons of <hi>Anack?</hi> And ſhall I at laſt be captivated by the weak Forces of the little Children of <hi>Gath?</hi> I remember I have read of <hi>Achilles,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:191991:42"/>Falling into the River</hi> Xanthus, <hi>that he was not ſo much terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the grim Countenance of Death, as the manner of it; Had</hi> Hector <hi>ſlain him in the Field, he had died with the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of its Glory; but to be drowned in the River like a little Boy, was a Fate more becoming a ſmooth fac'd</hi> Narciſſus, <hi>then a Warlike</hi> Achilles.</p>
               <p>How unworthy then is it for a Chriſtian, to prefer an eaſie, and entire Conqueſt over the Greateſt, and at laſt be enſlaved by the ſubtile Artifices of a leſs Temptation? Could the poor poſſeſſed man, who lived in the Tombs, by the Powers of the Devil, break his Iron Chains in pieces? and cannot I, aſſiſted with the Influences from above, break the Chains of Sin, and caſt away its Cords from me? If the Lord of Hoſts be on my part, who dare offend, who can oppoſe me? For were we ſo Wiſe and Valiant, as not to afright our ſelves with our own ſhadows, we ſhou'd find, by the Encouragements of Gods Spirit, that he who is with us, is mightier, than they who are againſt us; <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels are not only more Powerful and numerous, than the old Dragon and his ſuppoſed Strengths, but alſo more lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and careful to do us good: Did we not therefore look through the diſcoloured Mediums of our own polluted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Was not the Eye of our Souls tinctured by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of Luſt, we ſhould ſoon find our Strengths greater, then we imagine? For did we ſeriouſly weigh things in their proper ballance, we might obſerve an Heroick Vigour in all Goodneſs, and an Imbecility in Evil only.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if by the aſſiſtance of Grace, I can't prove my ſelf more than Conqueror over Temptations, why ſhould I rejoyce, when I fall into a variety and abundance of them? Or, can I imagine, that God, who remembers I am but Duſt, and knows whereof I am made; who is better acquainted with my Form and Figure than I my ſelf am, wou'd he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any thing upon me, but what he knows is abſolutely in my Power to perform?</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:191991:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Now you may obſerve both God and his Church, bind every Chriſtian at his firſt Admiſſion into Covenant, by the moſt Solemn Tye to reſiſt Temptations.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of which Oath in Baptiſm, is,</p>
               <p>I. N. <hi>or</hi> M. <hi>do here in the preſenee of God the Father, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and all the Heavenly Hoſt, devote my ſelf to the Services of my God; I call Heaven and Earth, Angels and Saints, the Church Militant and Triumphant, to bear witneſs, that I renounce the World, Fleſh, and the Devil, and that I will reſiſt their Temptations unto my laſt breath: This I avow to be my Reſolution; and upon this account, and this only, I now deſire to enter into Covenant with my God, and be Initiated and Admitted a Member of his Church; and I call my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Record this day, that I will never repent of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor revoke it, but continue Chriſts Faithful Souldier and Servant unto my Lives end.</hi> So help me O my God. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being the form of our Oath in Baptiſm, which we renew at our Confirmation, and repeat every time we Communicate at the Lords Table; we can certainly conclude it is to be performed; for can we fancy to our ſelves, God and his Church would urge us to Impoſſibilities, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to what cannot be effected? No certainly, for if men be perſwaded the Sins they commit, are irreſiſtable, why do they Sorrow and Repent, for what is paſt? Why do they contradict themſelves, and put a mock upon Heaven by promiſing Amendment for the future? Inſtead of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, why do they not rather Expoſtulate with God, and ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, O Lord, I have done many things amiſs as I have been Informed by the Parſon, who calls himſelf thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and trouble the World by thy Authority; which if they be offenſive, I proteſt, O my God, I could not help them, I had not Power to reſiſt them: If therefore thou wouldſt have me for the future perform thy expreſs Words and Commandments, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:191991:43"/>practice thoſe Duties our Preachers inculcate; thou muſt aſist me with a greater ſtock of Grace, than hitherto thou haſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me withall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now can I preſume any ſo horribly Profane, ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly Wicked to Pray after this method, and utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thoſe two abſolutely neceſſary parts of Repentance, Confeſſion and Contrition.</p>
               <p>If it be thus, I dare boldly affirm it, the greateſt Sins we are tempted to commit, are no Sins at all? But indeed God will be juſtified in his ſayings, and found clear when he is judged, for there is no thinking circumſpect man (if he applyes the Grace of God) can be over matched by any Tryal, or meet a Temptation, that is irreſiſtable: For if I can conquer Sin in the Mountains and Strong holds, I need not doubt but to baffle him in the Plains and Valleys; if I can overcome thoſe great and Gigantick Sins of Idolatry, Adultery, Fellony Treaſon and the like, why may I not eſcape thoſe of a leſſer magnitude, ſuch as Pamphleting the Government, and Libelling Authority, ſuch as Lying and Slandering, Cheating and Couſening, Back biting and Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king evil one of another? Shall a Pigmye ſubdue the Crane? or a Dwarfe prove Conquerour of a Gyant? Can I go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lyon and the Adder, and ſhall a Frog or a Worm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>liſorder me? Did not Chriſt come to redeem to himſelf a Church, and to preſent it, without Spot or Blemiſh, before the Throne of Grace? Now, how can We be of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and not under that qualification, <hi>Void of Offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. Some may enquire, how far we muſt proceed in Righteouſneſs that we may get a Conqueſt and Maſtery over our Nature; and be free from thoſe Imbecilities, in ſaying, <hi>What I hate, that do I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, There is no ſet or determinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Endeavour, but even as much as we can, or are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:191991:43"/>able: There is no ſize or Standard, the Exceſs of which would appear Monſtruous; But Religion is like unto the flawleſs Diamond, where bigneſs taxes the value, and the unuſual bulke both rates, and Enhances the Luſtre and the Price: To give God all that I can is the great command both of the Law, and of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>For ſo noble is the nature of Religion, that it admits of failings but by one of the Extremes, that of Defect. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity, which in other Paſſions is an Excellency, is here an Imperfection.</p>
               <p>It being therefore impoſſible for us to be too Loyal and Obedient, too Religious and Dutyful, we muſt make it the buſineſs of our Lives, the Care of our Thoughts, our only Concern and greateſt Imployment in the World, <hi>To be Holy as God is Holy;</hi> abſtaining from all things whatever that can impede or hinder the promotion and growth of an Holy Life; for what is our chiefeſt righteouſneſs better then Menſtruous Raggs, if the Lord was extreme to mark what we have done amiſs? After our very Innocency (which otherwiſe wou'd appear ſtain'd) may through the merits of Chriſt prove acceptable unto God; whatſoever thou findeſt in thy Heart to do, perform it with all thy might and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. He that will live according to the exact Rules of Chriſtianity, muſt bend his Nerves and Sinews, do his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt towards the demoliſhing all the Strong-holds of Satan. For we can never be clean and free from all Sin, until we have done our beſt and utmoſt towards the Mortification of it, for until that be done, how can we be ſatisfied where the blame and fault reſteth, or whether it can be effected, or not?</p>
               <p>If any man can profeſs, that Purity of Life, and ſtrictneſs of Converſation, as to aſſert, that he hath endeavoured to husband and employ his Talent of Grace to the moſt proper and beſt advantage; that he hath Endur'd as much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:191991:44"/>as is poſſible to be Endur'd, that he hath Loved as much as he could Love, that he hath Watched till he can Watch no longer; my Soul for his, that Man is blameleſs in the ſight of God, becauſe God hath commanded me to tell you, he does not expect Brick, where he does not afford Straw; he accepteth of what a man hath, requiring nothing which he is not able to perform.</p>
               <p>For God looks into my Heart, and enquires, if That be right, if I have no Rebellion in Thought, as well as Act, if I have no affections to Sin, no glances to Temptations? If I have liquoriſh deſires after the Onyons and Garlick, or Fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt;</hi> if I apply all prudent and effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to Mortifie my Sins; In a word, if I be ſincere and real in my Actions and Intentions: For, unleſs God (at his coming) find us in this Sinleſs ſtate, we muſt never expect the Bleſſing of his Kingdom; But if he does, my Soul for yours, we ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved by the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For conſult the Hiſtories of all the moſt vile and wicked men that ever had a Being upon Earth, and as you will find few or none, but ſometimes or other performing ſome good Action; and yet that Action did not interrupt, or put ſtop to their courſes of Impiety; ſo the moſt Religious of Pious Souls in like manner, have their Indiſcretions and Miſtakes, Failings and Errors; ſometimes doing that which is Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Sinful: Nevertheleſs, becauſe their Hearts ſtand moſt firm and right towards God, He in Mercy will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thoſe over ſights to Eternal Condemnation. The ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a Royal Inſtance to confirm this Doctrine, <hi>He was a man after Gods own Heart;</hi> Nay the Text tells you, <hi>He was blameleſs, ſave only in the matter of</hi> Uriah.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, did you never read, how he numbred the People; and can you not plainly read the Characters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath in that ſevere Judgement wherewith he Plagued his People for this his Tranſgreſſion; Yet ſtill becauſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:191991:44"/>was a good man, ſerving God with an upright Heart, not intending to diſoblige him, but committing this Sin through inadvertency, it was not imputed to him. In ſhort,</p>
               <p>If I endeavour all that I can to arrive at the Perfection I am capacitated for, and do what lyes in me to inherit the Promiſe; if I Labour and Hope for it, uſing the moſt ready and probable means, (not being deluded by the cunning Arts of a falſe and treacherous Heart) I ſhall ſtand upright in the Congregation of the Juſt; and though I cannot, with the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> challenge Heaven by Merit, yet I ſhall find it as my Saviour hath told me, <hi>My Fathers good pleaſure to give me a Kingdom.</hi>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>Fourthly, Thus you have the Imbecilities of Man natural, together with a Poſſibility, as well as abſolute Neceſſity of their Conqueſt by man Spiritual and Regenerate: For the Devil, as Potent and Crafty as he is, cannot raviſh our Wills, nor force our Inclinations; the worſt he can do, is to prompt and perſwade, to watch Advantages, and adminiſter ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sollicitations, but cannot compel us to entertain them.</p>
               <p>No man is undone or ruin'd Eternally, but himſelf is the Cauſe of it; he that would not, cannot be overcome, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he keep his Reſolutions fix'd and ſtedfaſt.

               <p>Let us Reverence the Greatneſs and Nobility of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being born anew, they are of too Divine a Frame and Temper, than to be Proſtituted and Defiled: Let all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:191991:45"/>opportunities and occaſions of Vice be avoided, with a quick and jealous care: A Temptation is eaſilier prevented, than removed, when once it has thruſt it ſelf upon the Sinner. We ſhould frequently review our Lives, and call our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a ſevere and impartial Account and Examination, that we may know what is their Spring and Fountain, what their Tendency and Inclination, and what will be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Iſſue of them; and that if the Politick Enemy of ours have conveyed in a Suggeſtion in diſguiſe, we may pull off the Mask and reſent it in its proper Form and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. And this reckoning ought to be enquir'd into, ſo ſoon as ever we have ſinned, or we know that he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the upper-hand over us; for the leſs Sin hath prevail'd, the eaſier the Fight, and Conqueſt more certain; But if he have had much better of us, the Argument is more forcible, becauſe we have the more to do, and therefore we muſt begin by times. The longer our Journey, the more early we muſt ſet out; we muſt not defer this Labour till it be render'd more difficult by Age, or impoſſible by Death. Nothing more true, than ſhort Tarryings create long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; if we neglect the Duties of our Sprightly years, our Journey will be more tedious, when our Vigour is decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we are weaken'd by Age. Oh! Bleſſed <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans!</hi> who were taught every night to call themſelves to an Account for the Actions of the preceding day!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sextius</hi> the <hi>Phyloſopher,</hi> never uſed to go to Bed, 'till he had firſt Expoſtulated with himſelf, ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What Evil Habit have I Cured to day? What Vice have I reſiſted? Wherein am I better than I was before?</hi> Oh! let Us imitate thoſe brave Examples, and accuſtom our ſelves to this excellent courſe, and then we ſhall quickly find our Victory over ſin far more eaſie and feazable. That then which we do, let us do quickly, whilſt the Marrow ſwells in our Bones, and our Blood be hot, and boils within our Veins,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:191991:45"/>before Evil days come, and we be ſnatch'd away, and there be none to deliver us. I Pray tell me, are not You and I, and all the Members of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> deſirous to end our days in Religion and Piety? To die in the Arms and Embraces of our <hi>Holy Mother</hi> the Church? To expire and breath out our laſt under the ſafe care and conduct of ſome Godly and Religious Miniſter? When we are Sick and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning our Souls to him, who lent them, then nothing but Prayers and doleful Complaints? The Groans of Timorous Repentance; and the faint Labours of an almoſt impoſſible Mortification? Yes, and leaſt your Souls ſhould miſcarry, we preſently diſpatch a little Mercury or Meſſenger for the deſpiſed Parſon. Then, and only Then, we look upon our Prieſt, (ſo much laugh'd at in our Plays, and made the <hi>May game</hi> of our Stage) as a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or Son of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; then we adjudge him as a Meſſenger or Phyſician ſent from God to heal our Plague-Sores; what are his Words, but Oracles? Religion, but Truth? Sin, but a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and moſt uneaſie to be born? And the Sinner more fooliſh than the Beaſts that periſh?</p>
               <p>But I Pray Sirs, as you prize your Souls, as you value Heaven, as you expect Eternal Life, or dread the Terrors of Everlaſting Burnings, ſeriouſly to conſider with me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Doctrines we Preach, the words we deliver, the Councels we give, are they not as True; now whilſt ye live and enjoy the Happy Priviledges of Health, as they be, when ye approach the Paths of Death? Why ſhould they not then have the ſame Powerful Influence, and make that impreſſion on our Lives now, they commonly do then? Let us then Mortifie our Sins betimes, leaſt we never Mortifie them at all; the Fable will tell you, <hi>The Snail out-went the Eagle, and wonne the Race, becauſe ſhe ſet out betimes.</hi> Let us begin our Warfare, whilſt it is called to day, reſolving to die unto the World, that we may be found alive unto
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:191991:46"/>God: Let us grow in Grace, going on to Perfection till we arrive at the full meaſures of the ſtature of Chriſt, and into the perfect Liberty of the Sons of God; ſo that we ſhall not complain in the Text, <hi>What I hate, that do I;</hi> but hate what God hates, doing nothing that is forbidden, not by virtue of our own Strength or Power, but becauſe Chriſt is our Strength, and he dwells in us, and we in him: Grant us Grace therefore we beſeech thee, O Lord, to withſtand the Temptations of World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and with pure Hearts and Minds to follow thee the only God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>
